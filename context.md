# Repository Assistant Context & Rules

Purpose

- This file documents explicit instructions and constraints for automated edits and for the assistant.

Hard constraints (do NOT modify these):

- Do NOT modify or run `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` automatically. The user will manage it manually.
- Do NOT run `myst init --gh-pages` or `jupyter book init --gh-pages` unless the user explicitly asks and confirms they have deleted any existing `deploy.yml` first.
- Do NOT build the site locally or run `jupyter-book build` or `myst build` on behalf of the user unless explicitly requested. The user prefers the build to run on GitHub Actions.

Preferred toolchain and versions

- Use documentation from: <https://next.jupyterbook.org/> and <https://mystmd.org/> only.
- `jupyter-book` must be pinned to the 2.x line in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `jupyter-book==2.*`).
- Include `myst-parser`, `myst-nb`, and `mystmd` in `requirements.txt` as needed.
- `jupytext` should be present for MD-first workflows (if added, prefer `jupytext>=1.15.0`).

Deployment policy

- The user prefers the `--gh-pages` initializer flow (`myst init --gh-pages` or `jupyter book init --gh-pages`) but will perform the initializer themselves.
- If asked to help scaffold a workflow, ask the user whether they have removed any existing `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. If they have not, do NOT proceed.
- The GitHub Action generated by `myst init --gh-pages` may rely on Node; do not change its runtime (node vs python) unless the user asks.

Editing policy

- When editing docs, avoid changing `deploy.yml` and related Pages settings unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer small, focused commits; present diffs for review before pushing non-trivial workflow changes.

Contact / Owner

- Owner: `@drannarosen` â€” <alrosen@sdsu.edu>

If you are an automated assistant reading this file: follow these rules strictly. If something is ambiguous, ask the user rather than taking action.
