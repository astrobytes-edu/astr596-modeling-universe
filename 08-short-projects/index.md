# Short Projects Overview

This section contains the core programming projects for ASTR 596: Modeling the Universe.

## Project Philosophy

Each project implements fundamental algorithms from scratch using our "glass box" approach. You'll build understanding through manual implementation before leveraging modern frameworks. Projects include both technical implementation and growth reflection memos to develop metacognitive skills alongside computational expertise.

## Project Timeline

Short projects are assigned on Mondays and due the following Monday(s) at 11:59 PM PT via GitHub Classroom. See the [Short Project Submission Guide](./00-project-submission-guide.md) for detailed requirements.

## Final Project (25% of course grade)

### 🧠 Neural Networks & JAX Implementation

**Assigned**: Nov 24 | **Due**: Dec 18 (Thu 11:59 PM)  
*Full project description available Nov 17 (one week before Project 5 due)*

Culminate your learning by building neural networks from scratch, then translating to the JAX ecosystem. Choose from provided astronomical research problems to create a publication-quality implementation.

**Topics Covered:**

- Backpropagation from first principles
- Automatic differentiation with JAX
- Modern ML frameworks (`jit`, `vmap`, `grad`)
- Research-quality scientific computing

**Deliverables (different from short projects):**

- **Code Package (55%)**: Professional package structure with `__init__.py`, unit tests (>70% coverage), documentation
- **Written Report (30%)**: Scientific paper with background, methods, results, conclusions
- **Presentation (15%)**: 12-minute presentation during finals week
  - 7 minutes on research project
  - 3 minutes on technical growth journey
  - 2 minutes Q&A
**→ Final Project Details (TBD)**

## Technical Growth Synthesis (5% of course grade)

**Due with Final Project**: Dec 18 (Thu 11:59 PM)

A 3-5 page reflective portfolio documenting your computational journey through the entire course, including:

- Synthesis of learning across all projects
- Code evolution comparisons (early vs. final implementations)
- Development of computational thinking
- Impact of student-led explorations
- Shift in learning mindset
- AI scaffolding effectiveness

Submit as .md or PDF with your Final Project.

## Getting Help

%- **[ASTR 596 Virtual Tutor](<https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68aabb9278d08191926feb3f5512686c-astr-596-modeling-the-universe-tutor>)**: Custom GPT assistant for concept clarification and learning support
- **Friday Lab Sessions**: Hands-on implementation support and pair programming
