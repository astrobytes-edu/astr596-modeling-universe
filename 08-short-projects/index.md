# Short Projects Overview

This section contains the core programming projects for ASTR 596: Modeling the Universe.

## Project Philosophy

Each project implements fundamental algorithms from scratch using our "glass box" approach. You'll build understanding through manual implementation before leveraging modern frameworks.

## Project Structure

The three short projects progress from foundations to advanced methods:

### üêç Project 1: Python Foundations & Stellar Physics

**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: OOP Design and Stellar Physics | **Due Date**:

- Professional development environment setup
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Stellar physics implementation
- Git workflow and documentation

[‚Üí Project 1 Details](00-project-submission-guide)

### ü™ê Project 2: N-Body Dynamics & Monte Carlo

**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Gravitational systems and statistical sampling

- Numerical integration methods
- N-body gravitational dynamics
- Monte Carlo sampling techniques
- Performance optimization

### üìà Project 3: Linear Regression & Machine Learning

**Duration**: 2 weeks | **Focus**: Statistical modeling from first principles

- Linear regression implementation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Cross-validation and model selection
- Astronomical data analysis

## Submission Guidelines

All projects follow consistent submission requirements designed to build professional development skills:

- **Modular `.py` scripts** (no Jupyter notebooks after Project 1)
- **GitHub version control** with meaningful commit history
- **Professional documentation** with clear README files
- **Project memos** explaining methodology and results

## Skills Development

Through these projects, you'll develop:

- **Computational thinking** for complex astrophysical problems
- **Professional coding practices** used in research and industry
- **Mathematical intuition** behind numerical methods
- **Scientific communication** through documentation and reports

## Getting Help

- **Pair programming sessions** during Friday lab time
- **Office hours** for conceptual guidance and debugging
- **Course Slack** for quick questions and peer support
- **AI tools integration** following our three-phase policy

Each project builds the foundation for the final neural networks project where you'll apply these skills to cutting-edge machine learning implementations.
