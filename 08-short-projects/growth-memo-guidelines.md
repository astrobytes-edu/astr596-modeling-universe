# ⚠️ Growth Memo Guidelines

This page describes the Growth Memo required for each short project. Keep this template concise; students should submit a 1–2 page reflection alongside their project implementation.

## Purpose

- Reflect on learning progress and technical decisions
- Record AI/tool usage and verification steps
- Highlight key debugging strategies and experiments

## Template (student submission)

1. Title, Date, Project Number
2. Short summary (2–3 sentences)
3. What I built (brief technical bullet list)
4. Key challenge(s) and how I addressed them
5. AI usage: tools used, prompts, verification (if any)
6. What I learned and next steps

## Instructor Notes

- Submit as `growth_memo.md` or PDF in project repo
- 1–2 pages recommended
- Grading: reflection quality, verification, and evidence of growth

<!-- Keep this page as a small template; expand later if needed. -->
