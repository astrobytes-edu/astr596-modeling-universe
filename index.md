Welcome to **ASTR 596: Modeling the Universe**! This course takes you on a journey from Python fundamentals to machine learning and cutting-edge JAX implementations, building transparent "glass box" models that reveal the physics underlying astronomical phenomena.

:::{tip} Course Philosophy: "Glass Box" Modeling

**Earned Complexity**: We implement fundamental algorithms from first principles before leveraging advanced frameworks. Every line of code serves understanding‚Äîno black boxes allowed until you've built the glass box yourself.

## Responsible AI Integration

:::{note} AI as a Learning Partner

This course teaches you to use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) as **learning amplifiers**, not replacement thinking. You'll develop critical evaluation skills while building the foundational knowledge that makes AI truly powerful.

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6)**: Foundation building with limited AI assistance  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12)**: Strategic AI integration with critical evaluation  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 12-16)**: Full AI partnership for advanced implementations
