# ASTR 596: Modeling the Universe

**SDSU | Fall 2025 | Fridays 11:00 AM - 1:40 PM | PA 215**

Welcome to computational astrophysics! This course takes you on a journey from Python fundamentals to cutting-edge JAX implementations, building transparent "glass box" models that reveal the physics underlying astronomical phenomena.

```{admonition} Course Philosophy: "Glass Box" Modeling
:class: tip

**Earned Complexity**: We implement fundamental algorithms from first principles before leveraging advanced frameworks. Every line of code serves understanding‚Äîno black boxes allowed until you've built the glass box yourself.

## Course Highlights

- **Glass Box Methodology**: Build understanding from first principles
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborative learning with rotating partnerships  
- **Modern Frameworks**: Bridge from NumPy to JAX ecosystem
- **Real Astrophysics**: Every project addresses genuine astronomical problems
- **Professional Skills**: Git, testing, documentation, and AI tool integration
- **Research Preparation**: Publication-quality code and cutting-edge methods

## Responsible AI Integration

```{admonition} AI as a Learning Partner
:class: note

This course teaches you to use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) as **learning amplifiers**, not replacement thinking. You'll develop critical evaluation skills while building the foundational knowledge that makes AI truly powerful.

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Foundation building with limited AI assistance  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Strategic AI integration with critical evaluation  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-15)**: Full AI partnership for advanced implementations
```

## Getting Started

1. üìñ Review the {doc}`course-info/syllabus` and {doc}`course-info/ai-guidelines`
2. ‚öôÔ∏è Set up your development environment (see {doc}`course-info/resources`)
3. üë• Join the course GitHub organization
4. üöÄ Start with {doc}`projects/project1`
