## Part 6: The Virial Theorem

### 6.1 The Universal Energy Balance

**Priority: 🔴 Essential**

:::{margin}
**Virial Theorem**  
For gravitationally bound systems in equilibrium, $2K + U = 0$, where $K$ is the total kinetic energy and $U$ is the total gravitational potential energy (negative). This means $K = -\frac{U}{2}$.
:::

The **virial theorem** emerges from taking the second moment of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Just as we derived conservation laws by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation, the virial theorem emerges from a special moment - one that involves both position and velocity.

For a stellar system, the moment of inertia $I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2$ measures how "spread out" the mass is. We can think about the "acceleration" of this moment:

$$\ddot{I} = \frac{d^2I}{dt^2} = \text{"acceleration" of the system's size}$$

If $\ddot{I} > 0$, the system is accelerating outward (explosive expansion). If $\ddot{I} < 0$, it's accelerating inward (runaway collapse). In equilibrium, we demand not just constant size ($\dot{I} = 0$) but no acceleration ($\ddot{I} = 0$).

When we compute $\dot{I}$ from the Boltzmann equation, we find:
$$\dot{I} = 2K + W$$

where $K$ is kinetic energy and $W = U$ is the gravitational potential energy. Setting $\dot{I} = 0$ for equilibrium immediately gives us:

$$\boxed{2K + U = 0}$$

where:
$$K = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i m_i v_i^2 \quad \text{(total kinetic energy)}$$
$$U = -\sum_{i<j} \frac{Gm_im_j}{r_{ij}} \quad \text{(total gravitational potential energy)}$$

**Physical intuition**: In equilibrium, the kinetic energy (trying to disperse the system) exactly balances half the binding energy (trying to collapse it). This specific ratio of 2:1 emerges from the 1/r nature of gravity.

:::{admonition} 💡 N-body Implementation Tips
:class: note

After decades of debugging N-body codes, the community has learned crucial lessons:

**1. Choose your units wisely**: Work in scaled physical units:
- Length in parsecs (pc)
- Time in megayears (Myr)  
- Mass in solar masses (M☉)

With these units, G ≈ 0.00449 pc³/(M☉·Myr²). Your positions might range from 0-100 pc, velocities 0-100 km/s, making them easy to interpret.

**2. Energy as your truth meter**: Track total energy E = K + U at every timestep:
$$\frac{|E(t) - E(0)|}{|E(0)|} < 10^{-10} \times N_{steps}$$

**3. Initial conditions matter**: Use a Plummer sphere or King model for realistic initial conditions already close to equilibrium.

**4. The 2-body problem is your friend**: Before running N=1000, test with N=2. An equal-mass binary should have a perfectly circular orbit if started correctly.
:::

This applies to all gravitationally bound systems:
- **Molecular clouds**: K from thermal motion
- **Stars**: K from thermal motion of particles
- **Star clusters**: K from orbital motion of stars
- **Galaxies**: K from stars + gas + dark matter (~85% of total mass)
- **Galaxy clusters**: K from galaxies + hot gas + dark matter

The profound discovery: When we apply the virial theorem using only visible matter, galaxies and clusters appear unbound! The observed kinetic energy requires 5-10× more mass than we can see. This "missing mass" is dark matter — discovered through the very equation you're learning.

### 6.2 Different Forms, Same Physics

The virial theorem takes different mathematical forms depending on what we're measuring:

**For a star cluster** (velocity dispersion):
$$M\sigma^2 = -\frac{U}{2} = \frac{GM^2}{2R}$$

This gives the fundamental scaling relation:
$$\boxed{\sigma^2 \sim \frac{GM}{R}}$$

**Key insight**: Measuring velocity dispersion $\sigma$ lets us "weigh" the system! If you observe $\sigma$ and know $R$, you can determine $M$ — this is how we measure dark matter in galaxies.

:::{admonition} 🌟 The More You Know: Vera Rubin's Revolutionary Persistence
:class: info, dropdown

While Fritz Zwicky first noticed the "missing mass problem" in galaxy clusters (1933) using the virial theorem, his work was largely dismissed. It was **Vera Rubin** who made dark matter undeniable through meticulous observations of galaxy rotation curves in the 1970s.

**What she expected**: Stars orbiting far from galactic centers should move slowly, like planets far from the Sun (Kepler's laws: $v \propto 1/\sqrt{r}$).

**What she found**: Stars at all radii orbit at roughly the same speed — the rotation curves are flat! This violated everything we knew about gravity unless...

**The revelation**: Each galaxy must be embedded in a massive halo of invisible matter. Using the virial theorem and her velocity measurements, she showed that galaxies contain 5-10× more dark matter than visible matter.

**The human story**: Rubin faced significant discrimination as one of the few women in astronomy. Princeton wouldn't admit women to their astronomy program. She was prohibited from using Palomar Observatory until 1965 because it "lacked proper bathroom facilities for women." Despite these obstacles, her careful, irrefutable data transformed our understanding of the universe.

Her work exemplifies how careful observation and simple physics (the virial theorem!) can reveal profound truths. Sometimes the universe's biggest secrets hide in the simplest equations.

### 6.3 The Virial Theorem as Diagnostic Tool

**Priority: 🔴 Essential**

The virial theorem provides the most important diagnostic for N-body simulations:

$$\text{Virial ratio} = \frac{|2K + U|}{|U|}$$

:::{warning}
**Common Misconception**: The virial theorem ($2K + U = 0$) is NOT the same as energy conservation ($K + U = E = \text{constant}$).

- **Energy conservation**: Always true for isolated systems
- **Virial theorem**: Only true for systems in equilibrium

A system can conserve energy perfectly while being far from virial equilibrium!
:::

**What different values mean:**

- **≈ 0**: System is perfectly virialized (equilibrium)
- **< 0.01**: Excellent equilibrium
- **0.01-0.1**: Acceptable for most purposes
- **> 0.1**: System not in equilibrium or numerical errors
- **Growing with time**: Energy conservation failing!

**Implementation hint for Project 2:**

```python
def check_virial(particles):
    """
    Check virial equilibrium for N-body simulation.
    Returns virial ratio - should be near zero for equilibrium.
    """
    # Calculate kinetic energy
    K = # Sum of (1/2) * m * v^2 for all particles
    
    # Calculate potential energy (the tricky part!)
    U = 0.0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i+1, N):  # Count each pair once
            r_ij = # distance between particles i and j
            U -= G * m[i] * m[j] / r_ij
    
    virial_ratio = abs(2*K + U) / abs(U)
    
    if virial_ratio > 0.1:
        print(f"WARNING: System not virialized! Ratio = {virial_ratio:.3f}")
    
    return virial_ratio
```

### 6.4 Connection to Ergodicity and MCMC

**Priority: 🟡 Standard Path**

The virial theorem assumes something profound that connects to Module 1: time averages equal ensemble averages.

For the virial theorem to hold, a system must explore its entire accessible phase space. Just as gas molecules sample all possible velocities through collisions, stars must sample all possible orbits consistent with their energy. This is ergodicity.

$$\langle K \rangle_{\text{time}} = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T K(t) \, dt = \langle K \rangle_{\text{ensemble}}$$

This is the **ergodic hypothesis** — a system explores all accessible phase space given enough time. This connects directly to your future work:

:::{admonition} 🔗 Connection to Project 4 (MCMC)
:class: note

The ergodic hypothesis underpins MCMC methods:

**In stellar dynamics**: A single star's orbit, followed long enough, samples the entire cluster's phase space distribution.

**In MCMC**: A single Markov chain, run long enough, samples the entire posterior distribution.

Both rely on ergodicity:
$$\langle A \rangle_{\text{time/chain}} = \langle A \rangle_{\text{ensemble/posterior}}$$

The virial theorem works because stellar orbits ergodically fill phase space. MCMC works because properly constructed chains ergodically sample parameter space.

## Part 3 Synthesis: The Universal Diagnostic

The virial theorem isn't just an equation — it's nature's way of telling us when a gravitational system has found its balance. Its universality is breathtaking:

### Why It Works Everywhere

The virial theorem applies to any system where:
1. Gravity is the dominant force (1/r potential)
2. The system has had time to relax toward equilibrium
3. External influences are negligible

This covers:
- Molecular clouds (with thermal pressure included)
- Star clusters (pure gravity)
- Galaxies (stars + gas + dark matter)
- Galaxy clusters (galaxies + hot gas + dark matter)
- The cosmic web (on appropriate scales)

### The Dark Matter Revolution

The virial theorem's greatest triumph was revealing the invisible universe:

1. **Observe**: Velocity dispersions in clusters
2. **Apply virial**: $M = R\sigma^2/G$
3. **Compare**: Virial mass >> visible mass
4. **Conclude**: Dark matter exists!

This simple application of statistical mechanics revolutionized cosmology.

### Your Computational Toolkit

For Project 2, the virial theorem becomes your:
- **Equilibrium diagnostic**: Is your system settled?
- **Energy conservation check**: Is your integrator working?
- **Initial condition validator**: Are you starting near equilibrium?
- **Physical insight tool**: Understanding energy partition

The same theorem that revealed dark matter will debug your code!
