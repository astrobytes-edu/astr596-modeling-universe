# ASTR 596 Textbook Revision: Complete Claude AI Workflow & Prompts

## Overview
This document provides the exact workflow and prompts for systematically revising your Python textbook using Claude AI. Follow these phases in order, completing each phase fully before moving to the next. Each prompt is designed to generate specific, actionable outputs that build toward your completed textbook.

**Important Setup Notes:** 
- Keep all files (Python chapters AND Getting Started module) attached to your Claude Project throughout the revision process
- The Getting Started files provide essential context about what students know about their development environment
- Switch between Claude styles strategically: Normal mode for analysis/documents, Explanatory mode for chapter revision

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Documents Setup
*Complete these before revising any chapters*

### 1.1 Comprehensive Terminology Analysis

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Start new conversation with all files attached and prompt:**
```
Analyze all uploaded Python chapters (files matching pattern XX-python*.md, from 01-python-environment through 10-scipy) to create a comprehensive Terminology Consistency Document.

For EACH technical term found:
1. Identify the chapter where it first appears
2. Extract how it's currently defined (quote the exact text if a definition exists)
3. Note ALL other chapters where this term appears
4. Identify any inconsistent usage or definitions across chapters
5. Flag terms that are used but never properly defined
6. Recommend a single, precise definition suitable for astronomy graduate students with no programming background

Organize the output as a markdown table with these columns:
- Term
- Current Definition (if any)
- First Appearance
- All Appearances 
- Inconsistencies Found
- Recommended Definition
- Priority (High/Medium/Low for fixing)

Highlight the following critical issues:
- Terms that change meaning between chapters
- Terms used before being defined
- Informal usage that should be formalized
- Multiple terms for the same concept

End with a "Critical Issues Summary" listing the top 10 terminology problems that need immediate attention during revision.

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) so I can easily review and save it.
```

**Save output as:** `terminology-consistency-initial-analysis.md`

### 1.2 Create Working Terminology Document

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Based on the terminology analysis we just completed, create a clean Terminology Consistency Document that I'll maintain throughout revision.

Format as a markdown table with:
- Term
- Standardized Definition (the recommended definition we'll use consistently)
- First Introduction (chapter where it should be formally defined)
- Notes (any special considerations or related terms)

Organize the terms into three groups:
1. Python Fundamentals (Chapters 1-6) - Core programming concepts
2. Scientific Computing Core (Chapters 7-9) - NumPy, Matplotlib, and robust computing terms
3. Advanced Topics (Chapter 10+) - SciPy and specialized concepts

For each term's standardized definition:
- Keep definitions concise but complete (1-2 sentences typically)
- Use language appropriate for astronomy graduate students with no programming background
- Ensure definitions build on previously defined terms where appropriate
- Include simple examples in the Notes column where helpful

At the end, add a "Usage Guidelines" section that explains:
- How to introduce terms (bold on first use, formal definition)
- When to reinforce definitions (after introducing complex applications)
- How to handle synonyms (e.g., "function arguments" vs "function parameters")

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Terminology Consistency Working Document" so I can easily review, save, and update it as I revise each chapter.
```

**Save output as:** `terminology-consistency-working.md`

### 1.3 Cross-Reference and Dependency Analysis

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze all Python chapters to identify concept dependencies and forward references.

Create a report showing:

1. FORWARD REFERENCES: Cases where a chapter mentions concepts not yet introduced
   - List each instance with chapter, the exact context/quote, and the future chapter where it's actually explained
   - Severity rating: "Blocking" (students can't understand without it) vs. "Minor" (helpful but not essential)
   - Suggested fix: remove, replace with simpler concept, or add brief explanation

2. DEPENDENCY CHAINS: Concepts that build on each other
   - Map which concepts require understanding of previous concepts
   - Show the logical progression (e.g., variables → lists → list comprehension)
   - Identify any circular dependencies or unclear progressions
   - Flag any "orphan" concepts that don't connect to others

3. ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE: Things chapters assume without verification
   - Environmental setup assumptions (e.g., "assumes NumPy is installed")
   - Mathematical background assumptions (e.g., "assumes understanding of logarithms")
   - Programming concepts assumed but not taught (e.g., "assumes familiarity with binary")
   - Getting Started content that's assumed but maybe not covered

4. REDUNDANT EXPLANATIONS: Concepts explained multiple times
   - Identify where the same concept is re-explained unnecessarily
   - Distinguish helpful reinforcement from redundant repetition
   - Note if later explanations contradict earlier ones
   - Suggest which explanation to keep as the primary one

Format as a structured report with clear sections and actionable fixes for each issue. Prioritize issues that would most confuse students or break the learning progression.

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Concept Dependency Analysis" so I can easily review and save it.
```

**Save output as:** `concept-dependency-analysis.md`

### 1.3b Forward Reference Strategy Guide (Supplementary)

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**After reviewing the Concept Dependency Analysis, create this supplementary document:**
```
Review the Concept Dependency Analysis we completed and create a "Forward Reference Strategy Guide" for handling concepts that appear before their full explanation.

Categorize each forward reference from the analysis into one of these types:

1. INCIDENTAL USAGE (Acceptable as-is)
   - Concepts that appear in examples but aren't essential to understanding the current topic
   - Students can understand the main lesson without fully grasping these details
   - Example: Using print() before explaining functions in detail
   - Strategy: Add brief marginal note or comment like "We'll explain this fully in Chapter X"

2. CONCEPTUAL PREVIEW (Pedagogically valuable)
   - Deliberate glimpses of future concepts that motivate current learning
   - Shows students where they're heading and why current material matters
   - Example: Showing array operations before teaching NumPy to motivate efficiency
   - Strategy: Add "Looking Ahead" box that acknowledges and contextualizes

3. NECESSARY EVIL (Unavoidable in Python)
   - Core Python concepts that can't be avoided even in early chapters
   - Example: Everything being an object, dot notation for methods
   - Strategy: Provide simple working definition, promise full explanation later

4. PROBLEMATIC REFERENCE (Needs revision)
   - References that genuinely confuse or block understanding
   - Concepts that require too much explanation to use casually
   - Example: Using decorators before functions are solid
   - Strategy: Remove or replace with simpler alternative

For each forward reference, provide:
- The concept and where it appears
- Its categorization (1-4 above)
- Recommended handling strategy
- Suggested phrasing for any notes/comments needed

At the beginning, add a "Philosophy Statement" about forward references that can go in Chapter 1 to prepare students for this learning approach.

End with a "Quick Reference Guide" showing common phrases to use when acknowledging forward references throughout the textbook.

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Forward Reference Strategy Guide" so I can use it during chapter revision.
```

**Save output as:** `forward-reference-strategy.md`

### 1.4 Create Exercise Opportunities Tracker

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Prompt:**
```
Based on all uploaded Python chapters, create an Exercise Opportunities Tracker for variable star light curve analysis.

For each chapter (01-python-environment through 10-scipy), identify:

1. KEY CONCEPTS that could connect to variable star analysis:
   - Which specific chapter topics naturally relate to analyzing stellar brightness variations
   - What level of light curve complexity is appropriate for this chapter's skill level
   - Which astronomical concepts students would be ready to understand

2. CURRENT EXERCISES (if any):
   - What exercises currently exist in the chapter
   - Their focus and complexity level
   - Whether they could be replaced or supplemented with light curve examples

3. OPPORTUNITIES for three exercise tiers:
   - Quick practice (5-10 lines): Simple concept reinforcement using light curve data
   - Synthesis (15-30 lines): Combining current chapter with previous knowledge
   - Challenge (optional): Research-level extensions for advanced students
   - Provide specific examples of what each exercise might do

4. DATA REQUIREMENTS:
   - What kind of light curve data would work (how many points, how clean)
   - Format needed (single column, time-magnitude pairs, with/without errors)
   - Suggested star type (Cepheid for regular, RR Lyrae for sawtooth, etc.)

5. DEPENDENCIES:
   - Which previous chapter exercises this would build upon
   - What functions/code from earlier exercises would be reused
   - How this prepares for future chapter exercises

Note: We'll develop the actual exercises AFTER all chapters are revised, but this tracker helps us see opportunities during revision and ensures the thread will flow naturally through the textbook.

Format as a structured markdown document with clear sections for each chapter. Include a summary at the end showing the overall progression from simple magnitude calculations to complete photometric analysis pipeline.

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Variable Star Exercise Opportunities Tracker" so I can easily review and save it.
```

**Save output as:** `exercise-opportunities.md`

## Phase 2: Pre-Revision Consistency Checks
*Run these checks before starting chapter revision*

### 2.1 Comprehensive Voice and Tone Analysis

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the voice and tone throughout all Python chapters (01-python-environment through 10-scipy) using a comprehensive sampling approach.

For each chapter, examine:
- The opening section (first 2-3 paragraphs)
- One explanation section from early in the chapter
- One code example explanation (how you introduce and explain a code block)
- One active learning element (Check Your Understanding, Debug This, etc.) if present
- One transition between major topics
- The closing section (final 2-3 paragraphs)

Report on:

1. CONSISTENCY: Does the voice remain consistent both within and across chapters?
   - Quote examples showing where voice changes significantly
   - Identify patterns: Does voice change between explanatory text and code discussions?
   - Note if certain types of content (theory vs. practice) have different tones
   - Compare how Chapter 1 explains concepts versus Chapter 10

2. ENERGY PATTERNS: Where and why does enthusiasm vary?
   - Map energy levels throughout each chapter (does it start strong then fade?)
   - Identify which types of content maintain energy (examples? exercises? explanations?)
   - Quote sections that feel particularly engaging or particularly dry
   - Note if energy correlates with topic difficulty or chapter length

3. EXPLANATION QUALITY: How well do you maintain teaching excellence throughout?
   - Are early explanations more careful and detailed than later ones?
   - Do code explanations maintain consistent clarity?
   - Are difficult concepts given appropriate setup and support?
   - Quote examples of particularly clear explanations to replicate elsewhere

4. STUDENT SUPPORT: How consistently do you encourage and reassure?
   - Track encouragement frequency across chapters
   - Note where students face difficult concepts without emotional support
   - Identify patterns: Do you forget encouragement during technical sections?
   - Find opportunities for more "you can do this" messaging

5. TECHNICAL WRITING CONSISTENCY: How uniform is your technical voice?
   - Are code comments consistently helpful or do they become terse?
   - Do mathematical explanations maintain consistent rigor?
   - Is terminology used consistently in context (not just definitions)?
   - Are complex ideas consistently broken into digestible pieces?

Provide specific examples with quotes and locations. End with:
- A heat map showing which chapters/sections need the most voice work
- Priority list of the most important tone issues to fix
- Examples of your best writing to use as models during revision

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Comprehensive Voice and Tone Analysis" so I can review and address these issues during revision.
```

### 2.2 Code Complexity Audit

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Prompt:**
```
Scan all code examples in Python chapters 01-10.

Create a report showing:
1. Examples exceeding 30 lines (list with line count and location)
2. Examples mixing multiple concepts (identify concepts and suggested splits)
3. Progression of complexity within each chapter (is it smooth or jarring?)
4. Balance of explanation vs. code (rough percentage per chapter)

Flag critical violations that need immediate attention during revision.

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Code Complexity Audit" so I can track what needs fixing.
```

### 2.3 Active Learning Elements Inventory

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking**

**Prompt:**
```
Inventory all active learning elements across Python chapters 01-10.

Create a table showing for each chapter:
- Number of "Check Your Understanding" boxes
- Number of "Computational Thinking" boxes
- Number of "Common Bug Alert" sections
- Number of "Debug This!" challenges
- Number of "Why This Matters" connections
- Distribution (are they well-spaced or clustered?)

Identify chapters significantly below the required minimums (3, 2, 2, 1, 2 respectively).

IMPORTANT: Create this as a new artifact (markdown format) titled "Active Learning Elements Inventory" so I know what needs to be added during revision.

```
I've completed revising Chapter [X]. Compare the revised chapter against our Terminology Consistency Document.

CHECK:
1. Are all terms used consistently with our standardized definitions?
2. Are new terms properly introduced with formal definitions?
3. Have I accidentally introduced terms not yet in our document?
4. Do any definitions need refinement based on how they're used?

Update the Terminology Consistency Document with any changes and flag any issues for attention in later chapters.
```

### 4.2 Dependency Verification

**Prompt:**
```
Verify Chapter [X] only uses concepts from Chapters 1-[X-1].

SCAN FOR:

- Check that OOP in Chapter 6 adequately prepares for NumPy's style
- Ensure exercise opportunities build progressively

Provide detailed report with any final fixes needed before moving to next module.
```

**Repeat similar check after Scientific Computing Core (7-9) and Advanced (10+)**

### 5.2 Cross-Module Transition Check

**Between modules, prompt:**
```
Review the transition from [Previous Module] to [Next Module].

CHECK:
1. Is the sophistication increase appropriate and acknowledged?
2. Do we need a bridge section explaining the level-up?
3. Are prerequisite concepts from previous module sufficient?
4. Should we add a "celebration" of what students have achieved?

Draft a brief transition section if needed.
```

---

## Phase 6: Final Complete Textbook Checks
*Only after all Python chapters are revised*

**Settings: Normal mode + Extended thinking for all final checks**

### 6.1 Comprehensive Terminology Audit

## Workflow Management Guidelines

### Style Switching Protocol
- **Phases 1-2**: Normal mode + Extended thinking (analysis and document creation)
- **Phases 3-4**: Explanatory/Learning style + Extended thinking (chapter revision)
- **Phases 5-8**: Normal mode + Extended thinking (checks and final development)

### Daily Workflow Pattern
1. Start by reviewing your Revision Decision Log from yesterday
2. Switch to appropriate Claude style for today's task
3. Run any pre-revision checks for today's chapter
4. Complete one chapter or major task
5. Run post-revision checks
6. Update all tracking documents
7. Note tomorrow's starting point

### File Management Protocol
- Original files: Keep with `-ORIG` suffix
- During revision: Save as `-REVISED`
- After module completion: Rename to final form
- Never delete originals until module is complete
- Save all artifacts with descriptive names

### Time Investment Estimates
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 5-6 hours
- Phase 2 (Pre-checks): 3-4 hours
- Phase 3-4 (Per chapter revision + checks): 3-5 hours × 10 = 30-50 hours
- Phase 5 (Module checks): 2-3 hours total
- Phase 6 (Final checks): 3-4 hours
- Phase 7 (Getting Started): 2-3 hours
- Phase 8 (Exercises): 8-10 hours
- **Total: 55-80 hours**

### Critical Success Practices
- Keep ALL files in your Claude Project throughout
- Update Terminology Document after EVERY chapter
- Handle forward references consistently per Strategy Guide
- Don't skip consistency checks between modules
- Switch Claude styles appropriately for each task type
- Celebrate completing each module!

## Key Principles to Remember

### Forward Reference Philosophy
Programming cannot be taught in perfectly linear fashion. Your textbook embraces "spiral learning" where concepts are encountered at increasing depth. Forward references are categorized and handled strategically:
- Incidental usage gets marginal notes
- Conceptual previews get "Looking Ahead" boxes
- Necessary evils get simple working definitions
- Problematic references get removed

### Module Sophistication Progression
- **Getting Started**: Hand-holding for absolute beginners
- **Python Fundamentals**: Patient, thorough, building foundations
- **Scientific Computing Core**: More technical, performance-aware
- **Advanced**: Research-grade sophistication

### Exercise Thread Strategy
The variable star light curve thread lives primarily in exercises, not main content. This preserves your existing examples while building a coherent research narrative through practice problems. Exercises progress from clean Cepheid data to realistic Betelgeuse observations.

---

## Your Mission

You're transforming your Python textbook into a pedagogically excellent resource that will serve as both initial learning material and career-long reference for your astronomy graduate students. Every hour invested in systematic revision following this workflow will:

- Save dozens of hours of student confusion
- Build their confidence as computational scientists
- Prepare them for real astronomical research
- Create a consistent, clear learning journey from zero to research-capable

The comprehensive analysis and consistency checks ensure your textbook has the polish and precision of professional educational materials. The variable star thread will transform exercises from isolated practice into genuine research experience with Betelgeuse's dimming event as the capstone achievement.
