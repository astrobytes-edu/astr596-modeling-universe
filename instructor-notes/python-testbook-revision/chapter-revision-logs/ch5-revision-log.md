- **Impacts Chapter 7:** Vectorization motivation established here
- **Depends on Chapter 1:** Module/import concepts must be solid

## 8. DECISION RATIONALE

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1:** Split 35-line module into 3 parts
- **Options considered:** A) Leave as is, B) Two parts, C) Three functional parts
- **Chosen:** C) Three parts by functionality
- **Rationale:** Each part teaches one concept clearly
- **Trade-offs:** Slightly more verbose but much clearer

**Decision 2:** Focus exercises on variable stars
- **Options considered:** A) Generic exercises, B) Mixed astronomy, C) Variable star pipeline
- **Chosen:** C) Complete variable star pipeline
- **Rationale:** Builds coherent thread through entire book
- **Trade-offs:** Less variety but stronger continuity

**Decision 3:** Integrate performance throughout
- **Options considered:** A) Separate performance section, B) Mentions throughout, C) Both
- **Chosen:** C) Both - mentions building to measurement
- **Rationale:** Reinforces that performance matters continuously
- **Trade-offs:** More complex narrative but better learning

### Alternative Approaches Rejected

**Rejected Approach 1:** Heavy focus on decorators
- **Why considered:** Decorators are powerful and widely used
- **Why rejected:** Too advanced for Chapter 5, better in Chapter 6 with OOP
- **Lesson:** Maintain appropriate complexity progression

**Rejected Approach 2:** Extensive GUI examples for modules
- **Why considered:** Students like visual feedback
- **Why rejected:** GUI programming is separate skill, distracts from core concepts
- **Lesson:** Stay focused on fundamental concepts

### Pedagogical Philosophy Notes
- Students need encouragement when facing scope confusion - it truly is difficult
- Real disasters (Hubble) and successes (LIGO) make abstract concepts concrete
- Performance awareness should be developed gradually, not dumped at once
- Variable star pipeline provides perfect complexity progression throughout book

## 10. REVISION SUMMARY

**Biggest Improvements:**
1. Added 10+ active learning elements (was only 3)

- MyST compliance: 9/10

**Ready for Student Use:** [x] Yes [ ] Needs minor fixes [ ] Needs major work

## Notes for Next Reviewer

The chapter successfully transforms students from script writers to software engineers. Pay special attention to:

1. The variable star exercises build a real, usable photometry module - ensure data files are provided
2. Performance integration is subtle but consistent - verify the narrative flow works
3. The Hubble and LIGO examples are simplified - may want expert review for complete accuracy
4. Functional programming section deliberately prepares for JAX without overwhelming beginners
5. The energy boosts and encouragements are calibrated for students who may be struggling - maintain this tone

The chapter exceeds all framework requirements and creates genuine excitement about building reusable astronomical software. Students who complete this chapter will have actual code they can share with colleagues.
