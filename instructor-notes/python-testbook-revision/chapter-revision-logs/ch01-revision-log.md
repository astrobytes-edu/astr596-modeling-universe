| NumPy arrays mentioned | "10x more efficient" claim | Replaced with "specialized data structures" |
| Matplotlib/Pandas | Specific tool examples | Replaced with generic "visualization/analysis" |
| Methods before Ch6 | Used throughout | Changed all to "functions" |

### Dependencies Verified
- [x] Getting Started module concepts properly assumed
- [x] No forward references to Python concepts
- [x] Command line knowledge appropriately expected

### Outstanding Issues

**üü° Important (Reduces clarity):**
- Issue: Some students may not have Git installed
  - Affects: Version control references
  - Suggested fix: Add note to check Getting Started

**üü¢ Nice-to-have (Enhancement):**
- Issue: Could add more Windows-specific examples
  - Enhancement: WSL discussion for Windows users

### Notes for Getting Started Module
- [x] Conda/Miniforge installation must be complete
- [x] Basic terminal navigation required
- [x] Git installation assumed

### Cross-Chapter Impacts
- **Impacts all chapters:** Sets IPython as primary interface
- **Impacts Ch2-6:** Establishes script-first approach

## 8. DECISION RATIONALE

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1:** Remove all NumPy/library references
- **Options considered:** Keep with notes, remove entirely, replace generically
- **Chosen:** Replace with generic terms
- **Rationale:** Avoid forward references completely
- **Trade-offs:** Lost some concrete examples

**Decision 2:** Focus on IPython over basic Python
- **Options considered:** Start with python, introduce IPython later, IPython-first
- **Chosen:** IPython-first approach
- **Rationale:** Better for scientific computing from start
- **Trade-offs:** Slightly steeper initial learning

**Decision 3:** Strong warnings about notebooks
- **Options considered:** Neutral presentation, mild warnings, strong warnings
- **Chosen:** Strong warnings with specific disasters
- **Rationale:** Students must understand the dangers
- **Trade-offs:** May seem overly negative

### Alternative Approaches Rejected

**Rejected Approach 1:** Gentle notebook introduction
- **Why considered:** Notebooks are popular
- **Why rejected:** Hidden dangers too severe
- **Lesson:** Better to be honest about limitations

**Rejected Approach 2:** Covering multiple IDEs
- **Why considered:** Students have preferences
- **Why rejected:** Too much cognitive load
- **Lesson:** Focus on one tool well

### Pedagogical Philosophy Notes
- Students need concrete failure examples to understand abstract dangers
- Environment problems are the #1 source of "broken" code
- Reproducibility must be emphasized from day one

- [x] All required sections present
- [x] 60/40 explanation/code ratio maintained

- [x] Margin definitions included
- [x] Cross-references work
- [x] Builds without errors (verified with jupyter-book start)

### Learning Objectives
- [x] All objectives measurable
- [x] All objectives covered in chapter
- [x] Exercises align with objectives

- [x] Exercise opportunity noted
- [x] Foundation for data handling in later chapters
