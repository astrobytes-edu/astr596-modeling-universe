# Revision Decision Log Template

## Instructions for Use

1. **Create a copy of this template for each chapter** and save as `revision-log-chXX.md`
2. **Fill out sections as you revise**, not after - captures decisions while fresh
3. **Use bullet points liberally** for quick capture of thoughts
4. **Include specific line numbers or section references** when noting changes
5. **Mark items with priority tags**: 🔴 Critical, 🟡 Important, 🟢 Nice-to-have
6. **Cross-reference other logs** when changes affect multiple chapters
7. **Update time spent incrementally** rather than estimating at the end
