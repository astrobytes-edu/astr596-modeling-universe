# ASTR 596: Scientific Computing with Python - Comprehensive Pedagogical Framework

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST
This document contains the EXACT specifications for creating and reviewing chapters for ASTR 596. Follow these instructions PRECISELY. Do not deviate from these guidelines. Every chapter must adhere to ALL requirements listed here.

**PLATFORM REQUIREMENT**: All chapters must be written for MyST Markdown/Jupyter Book 2 deployment on GitHub Pages. Use advanced MyST features to create interactive, web-native content.

## Core Mission
Transform astronomy graduate students from superficial coders into computational scientists who can:
- Implement algorithms directly from research papers
- Debug numerical instabilities in complex calculations
- Contribute to major computational projects
- Write robust, maintainable scientific software
- Create materials that serve as both initial learning resources and career-long references

## MANDATORY CHAPTER STRUCTURE

Every chapter MUST be a `.md` file with MyST frontmatter and contain these elements:

```markdown
---
jupytext:
  formats: md:myst
  text_representation:
    extension: .md
    format_name: myst
kernelspec:
  display_name: Python 3
  language: python
  name: python3
---
```

### Required Sections (in order):

1. **Learning Objectives** (5-8 measurable outcomes starting with action verbs)
2. **Prerequisites Check** (interactive checklist with chapter references)
3. **Chapter Overview** (3 paragraphs connecting to course trajectory)
4. **Main Content** (with ALL required active learning elements)
5. **Practice Exercises** (3-4, explicitly scaffolded)
6. **Main Takeaways (Summary)** (comprehensive narrative summary)
7. **Definitions** (alphabetical glossary of ALL technical terms)
8. **Key Takeaways** (bullet points with checkmarks)
9. **Quick Reference Tables** (organized lookup resources)
10. **Next Chapter Preview** (connection to upcoming content)

## MYST MARKDOWN REQUIREMENTS

### Interactive Code Blocks
All code examples must use MyST code-cell directives for execution:

````markdown
```{code-cell} ipython3
# This code executes in the browser
import numpy as np
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Mean: {np.mean(data)}")
```
````

### Advanced MyST Features to Include

#### Admonitions for Active Learning
Use MyST admonitions for all pedagogical elements:

````markdown
```{admonition} üîç Check Your Understanding
:class: question
What error would this code produce?
```

```{admonition} Click to see answer
:class: answer, dropdown
The answer with full explanation...
```
````

#### Tabbed Content for Comparisons
Use tabs to show alternative implementations:

````markdown
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Naive Implementation
```python
def simple_mean(data):
    return sum(data) / len(data)
```
```

```{tab-item} Robust Implementation
```python
def robust_mean(data):
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Empty data")
    return sum(data) / len(data)
```
```
````
````

#### Margin Content for Definitions
Place definitions in margins for easy reference:

````markdown
```{margin} **Key Term**
**Exception**: Python's way of signaling that something exceptional has happened preventing normal execution.
```
````

#### Interactive Figures with MyST
Use MyST figure directives with captions:

````markdown
```{figure} ./images/error_propagation.svg
:name: fig-error-prop
:alt: Error propagation through calculations
:align: center
:width: 80%

How a single error cascades through a computational pipeline, corrupting all downstream results.
```
````

#### Cross-References
Use MyST referencing throughout:

````markdown
As we learned in {ref}`chapter-5-functions`, functions should validate inputs.

See {numref}`fig-error-prop` for visualization of error propagation.

{doc}`../chapter-07/numpy-arrays` covers array operations in detail.
````

### Code Output Display
Show code output using MyST output directives:

````markdown
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]

result = complex_calculation()
print(result)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

# Long output that scrolls
for i in range(100):
    print(f"Processing {i}")
```
````

## STRICT CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### Code Complexity Limits
- **MAXIMUM 30 lines per code example** (most should be 10-20 lines)
- **ONE concept per example** - never mix multiple concepts
- **Build complexity through SEQUENCE, not single blocks**
- **Each example must be complete and runnable**
- **Use code-cell directives for ALL Python code**
- **Violating these limits requires complete restructuring**

### Prose Requirements
- **60% explanation, 40% code** - maintain this ratio throughout
- **Define EVERY technical term** when first introduced (use margin notes)
- **Bold all keywords** on first use and when central to concepts
- **Explain WHY before HOW** - motivation precedes implementation
- **Use full sentences and paragraphs** - bullets only in reference tables
- **Include real-world consequences** (disasters, retracted papers, wasted time)

### Progressive Complexity Model
Each concept must progress through these stages:
1. **Conceptual introduction** (what and why in plain language)
2. **Simplest possible example** (5-10 lines, one idea)
3. **Realistic application** (10-20 lines, practical use)
4. **Robust implementation** (15-30 lines, with validation)
5. **Performance considerations** (if applicable)

## REQUIRED ACTIVE LEARNING ELEMENTS (MYST FORMAT)

### Mandatory Components (MUST include ALL)

## EXAMPLE COMPLEXITY GUIDELINES FOR PYTHON TEXTBOOK

### Primary Goal: TEACH PYTHON, not astrophysics

Examples should illuminate Python concepts, not require astronomy knowledge. If students need to understand stellar physics to understand the code, the example is too complex.

### Astrophysics Examples: Keep It Simple
‚úÖ **USE THESE TYPES**:

- Mechanics and conservation laws
- electromagnetic radiation basics
- Kepler's laws (orbital periods, semi-major axes)
- Simple gravitational calculations (F = GMm/r¬≤)
- Basic power-law stellar physics relationships (L ‚àù R¬≤T‚Å¥)
- Temperature conversions (Kelvin/Celsius)
- Magnitude calculations (apparent/absolute)
- Simple redshift (z = ŒîŒª/Œª)
- Basic stellar properties (mass, radius, temperature)
- Planet/star data as lists/arrays
- Distance calculations (au, parsecs)
- Simple coordinate conversions
- etc.

‚ùå **AVOID THESE**:

- Complex spectral line analysis
- Detailed photometry pipelines
- CCD reduction workflows
- Telescope pointing corrections
- Atmospheric extinction corrections
- Complex coordinate transformations
- Multi-band color corrections
- PSF fitting
- Image registration/stacking
- Detailed radiative transfer

### Numerical Methods: Start Basic

‚úÖ **APPROPRIATE METHODS** (to illustrate programming concepts):
- **Bisection method**: Finding roots (e.g., when does orbit cross certain radius)
- **Rectangle/Trapezoidal rule**: Simple integration (e.g., area under light curve)
- **Euler's method**: Basic differential equations (e.g., cooling of a planet)
- **Simple Monte Carlo**: Random sampling (e.g., estimating œÄ or stellar collision probability)
- **Linear interpolation**: Between data points
- **Basic statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation of measurements
- **Simple finite differences**: Numerical derivatives

‚ùå **TOO ADVANCED** (save for specialized courses):
- Newton-Raphson method
- Runge-Kutta (including Leapfrog)
- Gaussian quadrature
- FFT and signal processing
- Matrix decomposition methods
- Optimization algorithms (gradient descent, etc.)
- Symplectic integrators
- Adaptive timestep methods

### Example Philosophy
Each example should:
1. **Teach a Python concept first** (loops, functions, classes, etc.)
2. **Use astronomy for context**, not complexity
3. **Be solvable in <30 lines of code**
4. **Require minimal physics and astrophysics knowledge** (intro college level)
5. **Build toward later examples** progressively

### Good Example Pattern
```python
# GOOD: Teaching list comprehensions with stellar data
# Simple, clear, focuses on Python syntax
star_temps = [5778, 3500, 9940, 6000, 4900]  # Kelvin
star_colors = ['yellow' if 5000 < T < 6000 else 'other' 
               for T in star_temps]

# BAD: Too much astrophysics obscures the Python
# Requires understanding of blackbody radiation, Wien's law, etc.
def planck_function(wavelength, T):
    return (2*h*c**2/wavelength**5) / (np.exp(h*c/(wavelength*k*T)) - 1)
