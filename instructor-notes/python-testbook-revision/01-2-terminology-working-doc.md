| **Module** | A single Python file (.py) containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and reused. | Ch01 | Example: `math` is a module, `math.py` is the file |
| **Package** | A directory containing multiple Python modules and an `__init__.py` file, organizing related code hierarchically. | Ch01 | Example: `numpy` is a package containing many modules |
| **Import** | The process of loading code from a module or package to use in your current program. | Ch01 | Distinguish the verb (import) from the noun (module) |
| **Script** | A Python file intended to be run directly from the command line, containing a sequence of commands. | Ch01 | Contrast with modules (imported) and notebooks (interactive) |
| **Variable** | A name that refers to a value stored in memory. | Ch02 | Emphasize variables don't contain values, they refer to them |
| **Float/Floating-point** | A number with a decimal point, represented in computer memory using scientific notation with limited precision. | Ch02 | Use "floating-point number" formally, "float" as shorthand |
| **Integer** | A whole number without a decimal point, represented exactly in computer memory. | Ch02 | Contrast with float's precision limitations |
| **String** | A sequence of characters (text) enclosed in quotes. | Ch02 | Immutable sequence type |
| **Type** | The category of data that determines what operations can be performed on it (int, float, str, etc.). | Ch02 | Use `type()` function to check |
| **Expression** | A combination of values, variables, and operators that Python evaluates to produce a result. | Ch02 | Example: `2 + 3 * x` |
| **Statement** | A complete instruction that Python can execute. | Ch02 | Example: `x = 5` or `print(x)` |
| **Iteration** | The process of repeatedly executing code for each item in a sequence. | Ch03 | The action performed by loops |
| **Iterator** | An object that can be traversed through its elements one at a time. | Ch03 | What a `for` loop uses behind the scenes |

| **Set** | A mutable collection of unique, unordered elements with O(1) membership testing. | Ch04 | Use for removing duplicates or fast membership tests |
| **Mutable** | Objects whose state can be modified after creation (lists, dictionaries, sets). | Ch04 | Can be changed in-place |
| **Immutable** | Objects whose state cannot be modified after creation (tuples, strings, numbers). | Ch04 | Must create new object to "change" |
| **Index** | The numerical position of an element in a sequence, starting from 0. | Ch04 | Negative indices count from the end |
| **Slice/Slicing** | Extracting a portion of a sequence using `[start:stop:step]` notation. | Ch04 | Creates a new object (usually) |
| **Function** | A reusable block of code that performs a specific task, taking inputs and returning outputs. | Ch05 | Defined with `def` keyword |
| **Parameter** | A variable in a function definition that receives a value when the function is called. | Ch05 | In `def f(x):`, `x` is a parameter |
| **Argument** | The actual value passed to a function when calling it. | Ch05 | In `f(5)`, `5` is an argument |

| **Namespace** | A container that holds a set of identifiers and their associated objects, preventing naming conflicts. | Ch05 | Each module has its own namespace |
| **Class** | A blueprint for creating objects that bundles data (attributes) and behavior (methods). | Ch06 | Defined with `class` keyword |
| **Object** | A specific instance created from a class, containing its own data. | Ch06 | Everything in Python is an object |
| **Instance** | A specific object created from a class (synonym for object, emphasizing its origin). | Ch06 | Use when emphasizing "instance of a class" |
| **Method** | A function defined within a class that operates on instances of that class. | Ch06 | Always has `self` as first parameter |
| **Attribute** | A variable bound to an object or class, accessed using dot notation. | Ch06 | Example: `obj.attribute` |
| **Constructor** | The special method `__init__` that initializes new instances of a class. | Ch06 | Called automatically when creating objects |

## Usage Guidelines

### How to Introduce Terms

1. **First Use in Text:**
   - Bold the term: **module**
   - Provide immediate definition in the same sentence or next sentence
   - Add margin definition using MyST syntax if term will be used frequently
   - Example: "A **module** is a single Python file containing code that can be imported and reused."

2. **Formal Definition Box:**
   - Use MyST admonition for critical terms that need emphasis
   ```markdown
   ```{admonition} Definition: Module
   :class: definition
   A module is a single Python file (.py) containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and reused in other programs.
   ```
   ```

3. **Glossary Entry:**
   - Include in chapter-end definitions section
   - Alphabetical order
   - Cross-reference related terms

### When to Reinforce Definitions

- **After Complex Examples:** When showing advanced usage, remind readers of the basic definition
- **Start of New Chapters:** Brief reminder if term is central to new content
- **In Debugging Sections:** When misunderstanding the term might cause errors
- **In Exercises:** Include terminology review in "Check Your Understanding" boxes

### Handling Synonyms and Related Terms

1. **Parameters vs Arguments:**
   - Define both clearly when introducing functions
   - Use correctly and consistently throughout
   - Add note: "Remember: parameters in definition, arguments in call"

2. **Float vs Floating-point:**
   - Use "floating-point number" in formal definitions
   - "float" is acceptable as shorthand after introduction
   - Be consistent within each chapter

3. **Object vs Instance:**
   - Use "instance" when emphasizing "instance of a specific class"
   - Use "object" for general discussion
   - Note their synonymous nature when introducing OOP

4. **Method vs Function:**
   - Never use "method" before Chapter 6
   - Always use "function" for standalone code blocks
   - After Chapter 6, be precise: "method" only for functions in classes

### Cross-References

- When a term depends on understanding another term, explicitly reference it
- Example: "A **method** is a function (defined in Chapter 5) that belongs to a class."
- Use MyST cross-references: `{ref}`function-definition`` to link to previous definitions

### Consistency Checks

Before finalizing each chapter:
1. Search for all technical terms
2. Verify they match standardized definitions
3. Ensure terms are defined before first use
4. Check that examples use terminology consistently
5. Confirm margin definitions match glossary entries

### Special Considerations

- **For Astronomy Context:** When possible, use astronomy-related examples
- **For No-Programming Background:** Avoid programming jargon in definitions; use plain language
- **For Career-Long Reference:** Include both conceptual understanding and practical usage
