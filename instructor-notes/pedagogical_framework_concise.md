## COMPREHENSIVE PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE CHECK

Review the provided chapters against EVERY requirement in the ASTR 596 pedagogical framework. No exceptions.

### MANDATORY CHAPTER STRUCTURE (All 10 sections required, in order):
1. **Learning Objectives**: 5-8 measurable outcomes starting with action verbs
2. **Prerequisites Check**: Interactive checklist with chapter references
3. **Chapter Overview**: 3 paragraphs connecting to course trajectory
4. **Main Content**: With ALL required active learning elements
5. **Practice Exercises**: 3-4 exercises, explicitly scaffolded in 3 parts each
6. **Main Takeaways**: 300-500 word narrative summary
7. **Definitions**: Alphabetical glossary of ALL technical terms
8. **Key Takeaways**: Bullet points with checkmarks
9. **Quick Reference Tables**: Organized lookup resources
10. **Next Chapter Preview**: Connection to upcoming content

### CODE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
- **Maximum 30 lines per example** (NO EXCEPTIONS)
- **ONE concept per code example**
- **60% explanation, 40% code ratio**
- **Progressive complexity**: conceptual → simple → realistic → robust
- **ALL code in MyST code-cell directives** (not markdown code blocks)
- **CGS units for all astronomical values**
- **Unit comments in code**

### EXAMPLE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:

**PRIMARY GOAL**: TEACH PYTHON AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
- Astrophysics provides context, NOT complexity
- Examples illuminate Python concepts (loops, functions, classes, etc.)
- Scientific examples show computational thinking
- If explaining physics takes >2 sentences, example is too complex

**Good Example Pattern**:
```python
# GOOD: Teaching list comprehensions with stellar data
# Focus is on PYTHON SYNTAX, astronomy is just context
star_temps = [5778, 3500, 9940, 6000, 4900]  # Kelvin
hot_stars = [T for T in star_temps if T > 6000]  # List comprehension!

# BAD: Too much physics obscures the Python lesson
# This teaches astrophysics, not Python
def planck_function(wavelength, T):
    return (2*h*c**2/wavelength**5) / (np.exp(h*c/(wavelength*k*T)) - 1)
```

**Appropriate Astrophysics Examples** (simple context only):
✅ USE: Kepler's laws, F = GMm/r², L ∝ R²T⁴, simple magnitudes, redshift z = Δλ/λ, temperature conversions, basic orbital mechanics
❌ AVOID: Complex spectroscopy, CCD reduction, PSF fitting, detailed radiative transfer, complex stellar evolution

**Numerical Methods Allowed** (for teaching algorithms, not physics):
✅ USE: Bisection, rectangle/trapezoidal rule, Euler's method, basic Monte Carlo, linear interpolation, finite differences
❌ AVOID: Newton-Raphson, Runge-Kutta, Leapfrog, gradient descent, matrix decomposition

**CGS Units (REQUIRED for astronomy examples)**:
- Distance: cm (NOT meters)
- Mass: grams (NOT kg)  
- Time: seconds
- Energy: ergs (NOT Joules)
- Luminosity: erg/s (NOT Watts)
- Constants: G = 6.674×10⁻⁸ cm³/g/s², c = 2.998×10¹⁰ cm/s

### ACTIVE LEARNING MINIMUMS (per chapter):
- ≥3 "Check Your Understanding" boxes
- ≥2 "Computational Thinking" boxes
- ≥2 "Common Bug Alert" sections
- ≥1 "Debug This!" challenge
- ≥2 "Why This Matters" real-world examples

### VARIABLE STAR EXERCISE THREAD:
Progressive but concise (10-20 minutes each), teaching PYTHON not astronomy:
- Chapter 1: Variables/types with period, magnitude (5-10 lines)
- Chapter 2: Control flow with star classification (10-15 lines)
- Chapter 3: Functions for phase folding (15-20 lines)
- Chapter 4: Data structures with star collections (15-20 lines)
- Chapter 5: File I/O with star data (20-25 lines)
- Chapter 6: VariableStar class (25-30 lines)

### MYST/JUPYTER BOOK 2 REQUIREMENTS:
```markdown
# Every chapter must start with:
---
jupytext:
  formats: md:myst
  text_representation:
    extension: .md
    format_name: myst
kernelspec:
  display_name: Python 3
  language: python
  name: python3
---
```

- Use proper admonition classes: `{admonition}`, `{note}`, `{warning}`, `{tip}`
- Include `{margin}` definitions for technical terms
- Cross-reference with `{ref}` and `{doc}`
- ALL equations in LaTeX math mode: `$inline$` or `$$display$$`
- Glossary using MyST glossary directive
- Code cells: ` ```{code-cell} ipython3`

### PEDAGOGICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Build complexity progressively** within each chapter
- **Reference previous chapters** explicitly
- **Define terms on first use** (margin definitions)
- **Include performance comparisons** where relevant
- **Provide collapsible solutions** for exercises
- **Use tabs** for alternative approaches
- **Include Mermaid diagrams** for complex flows

### EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS:
Each exercise must have:
1. **Part A**: Follow exact steps (muscle memory)
2. **Part B**: Modify slightly (understanding)
3. **Part C**: Apply independently (mastery)

Solutions in collapsible boxes with `{dropdown}` directive.

### REFERENCE VALUE:
Must serve as both:
- Initial learning resource for beginners
- Career-long reference for professionals

Include comprehensive glossaries, reference tables, and cross-references.

### REVIEW OUTPUT REQUIRED:

For EACH chapter provide:

**1. Compliance Checklist:**
- [ ] All 10 sections present and ordered correctly
- [ ] Frontmatter correct
- [ ] Code examples ≤30 lines
- [ ] 60/40 ratio maintained
- [ ] Active learning minimums met
- [ ] MyST directives used properly
- [ ] CGS units throughout
- [ ] Equations in math mode
- [ ] Exercises properly scaffolded
- [ ] Examples teach PYTHON not astrophysics

**2. Violations Report:**
- List EVERY deviation from requirements
- Specify exact location of violation
- Provide required correction

**3. Missing Elements:**
- List any missing active learning elements
- Note absent glossary terms
- Identify missing cross-references
- Flag incomplete exercises

**4. Code Assessment:**
- Any examples >30 lines? (CRITICAL VIOLATION)
- Multi-concept examples? (must split)
- Examples teaching Python or physics? (must be Python)
- Progressive complexity maintained?
- MyST code-cell directives used?

**5. Final Verdict:**
- COMPLIANT: Meets ALL requirements
- MINOR FIXES: Small corrections needed (list)
- MAJOR REVISION: Significant framework violations
- REJECT: Fundamental restructuring required

### CONTEXT:
- **PRIMARY GOAL: Teach Python and scientific computing**
- **Astronomy/physics are just familiar contexts, not the lesson**
- Students have NO programming background
- Course uses CGS units (cm, g, s, erg, dyne)
- Exercises are optional practice (not graded)
- Must work on GitHub Pages (static site)

### CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- NO code example may exceed 30 lines - this is ABSOLUTE
- Examples must teach PYTHON CONCEPTS, not astrophysics
- Every technical term needs definition
- All 10 sections are MANDATORY
- MyST format is REQUIRED (not optional)
- Active learning elements are MINIMUMS (more is better)
- If physics explanation > Python explanation, example is wrong

If ANY requirement is not met, the chapter is NOT ready for deployment.
