data structures mastered, Chapter 5 will explore functions and modules - how to organize code for reusability, testing, and collaboration. You’ll learn how Python’s function model, with first-class functions and closure support, enables powerful patterns like decorators and functional programming techniques. These concepts prepare you for building modular physics engines, creating reusable analysis pipelines, and understanding the functional programming paradigm used in modern frameworks like JAX where functions transform into automatically differentiable computational graphs.
