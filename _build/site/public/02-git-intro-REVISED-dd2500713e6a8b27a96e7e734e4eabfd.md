# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Why Version Control Will Save Your Research

**Imagine this:** It's 2 AM, three days before your thesis defense. You accidentally delete 400 lines of working code while trying to "clean up." Or worse—your laptop dies, taking six months of work with it.

**This happens to someone every semester.**

Git prevents these disasters. It's your safety net, collaboration tool, and scientific record all in one. By the end of this guide, you'll never lose work again.

:::{tip} 🎯 What You'll Learn

After this guide, you'll be able to:
- ✓ Never lose code again (even if your laptop explodes)
- ✓ Submit assignments via GitHub Classroom
- ✓ Collaborate without fear of overwriting others' work
- ✓ Track exactly what changed and when
- ✓ Recover from mistakes quickly
:::

## The Version Control Nightmare (Without Git)

We've all been here:
```
stellar_evolution.py
stellar_evolution_v2.py
stellar_evolution_v2_FIXED.py
stellar_evolution_v2_FIXED_actually_works.py
stellar_evolution_OLD_DO_NOT_DELETE.py
stellar_evolution_FINAL.py
stellar_evolution_FINAL_REAL.py
stellar_evolution_FINAL_REAL_USE_THIS_ONE.py
```

With Git, you have ONE file with complete history. Every change is tracked, documented, and reversible.

## Understanding Git: The Mental Model

Think of Git as a **time machine for your code** with three areas:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Working Directory<br/>Your files] -->|git add| B[Staging Area<br/>Ready to save]
    B -->|git commit| C[Repository<br/>Permanent history]
    C -->|git push| D[GitHub<br/>Cloud backup]
    D -->|git pull| A
```

1. **Working Directory**: Your actual files
2. **Staging Area**: Changes ready to be saved
3. **Local Repository**: Your project's history (on your computer)
4. **Remote Repository**: Cloud backup (GitHub)

## Initial Setup (One Time Only)

### Step 1: Install Git

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Tab 1
:sync: tab1
Tab one
:::
:::{tab-item} Tab 2
:sync: tab2
Tab two
:::
::::

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} macOS
:sync: tab1
Git comes pre-installed. Verify with:
```bash
git --version
```
If not installed, it will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.
:::

:::{tab-item} Linux
:sync: tab2
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: tab3
Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win

**Important**: During installation, select:
- "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
- "Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor"
- "Override default branch name" → type "main"
- "Git Credential Manager" (helps with authentication)

After installation, use **Git Bash** for all Git commands (not Command Prompt).
:::
::::

### Step 2: Configure Your Identity

```bash
# Tell Git who you are (for commit messages)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@sdsu.edu"

# Set default branch name to 'main' (GitHub's default)
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Set default editor (optional but helpful)
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # For VS Code

# Verify configuration
git config --list
```

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Account

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Sign up with your **SDSU email** (critical for Student Pack!)
3. Verify your email address
4. Apply for Student Developer Pack: https://education.github.com/pack
   - Free GitHub Pro account
   - **GitHub Copilot Pro** (free for students - normally $10/month)
   - GitHub Codespaces hours
   - Access to 100+ developer tools
   
:::{note} 📚 Student Developer Pack Benefits

The pack includes professional tools worth thousands of dollars:
- **GitHub Copilot Pro**: AI pair programmer (disabled for this course initially)
- **Cloud credits**: Azure ($100), DigitalOcean, and more
- **Domain names**: Free .tech, .me domains
- **Learning platforms**: DataCamp, Educative, and others

Verification typically takes 1-72 hours. You'll get an email when approved.
:::

### Step 4: Set Up Authentication

:::{important} 🔐 Required Since August 2021

GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations. You need either:
1. **Personal Access Token (easier)** - We'll use this
2. SSH Keys (more secure but complex)

We'll use Personal Access Tokens (classic) for simplicity. GitHub also offers "fine-grained" tokens with more security, but classic tokens are simpler for course work.
:::

**Create a Personal Access Token:**

1. Go to GitHub → Click your profile picture → Settings
2. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**
3. Under **Personal access tokens**, click **Tokens (classic)**
4. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
5. Name it "ASTR 596 Course"
6. Set expiration to after the semester ends
7. Check these scopes:
   - ✓ repo (all)
   - ✓ workflow (if using GitHub Actions)
8. Click **Generate token**
9. **COPY THE TOKEN NOW!** You won't see it again!

**Save your token securely:**
```bash
# Configure Git to remember credentials (so you don't paste token every time)
git config --global credential.helper cache  # Linux/Mac: remembers for 15 min
git config --global credential.helper manager  # Windows: saves permanently

# First time you push, Git asks for:
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: paste-your-token-here (NOT your GitHub password!)
```

:::{warning} 💡 Token vs Password

When Git asks for "password", paste your TOKEN, not your actual GitHub password!
The token acts as your password for Git operations.
:::

## The Essential Five Commands

Master these five commands and you can use Git for this entire course:

:::{list-table} The Essential Five
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 30 70

* - Command
  - Purpose
* - `git status`
  - What's changed? (USE THIS CONSTANTLY)
* - `git add .`
  - Stage all changes for commit
* - `git commit -m "message"`
  - Save changes with description
* - `git push`
  - Upload to GitHub
* - `git pull`
  - Download latest changes
:::

## GitHub Classroom: Assignment Workflow

:::{important} 📚 How GitHub Classroom Works

GitHub Classroom automates assignment distribution and collection:

1. Professor creates assignment with starter code
2. You get a personalized repository (forked from template)
3. You work and push changes
4. **Your last push before deadline = your submission**
5. Professor sees all submissions automatically

No uploading files, no Canvas submissions, no "did you get my email?"

**Note**: As of 2024, GitHub Classroom creates student repos as forks, allowing professors to update starter code even after you've accepted the assignment.
:::

### Accepting Your First Assignment

1. **Click assignment link** (provided on Canvas/Slack)
   - Link looks like: `https://classroom.github.com/a/xyz123`

2. **Accept the assignment**
   - First time: Authorize GitHub Classroom
   - Select your name from the roster
   - Click "Accept this assignment"

3. **Wait for repository creation** (~30 seconds)
   - You'll see "Your assignment has been created"
   - Click the link to your repository

4. **Your repository is created!**
   - URL format: `github.com/sdsu-astr596/project1-yourusername`
   - This is YOUR personal copy

### Working on Assignments

```bash
# 1. Clone your assignment repository
git clone https://github.com/sdsu-astr596/project1-yourusername.git
cd project1-yourusername

# 2. Work on your code
# Edit files, test, debug...

# 3. Check what's changed
git status

# 4. Stage your changes
git add .

# 5. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Implement stellar mass calculation"

# 6. Push to GitHub (this is your submission!)
git push
```

:::{warning} ⚠️ Critical: Submission = Push

**Your submission is whatever is pushed to GitHub by the deadline!**
- No "submit" button needed
- Push early, push often
- You can push unlimited times before deadline
- Check GitHub.com to verify your code is there
:::

### Verifying Your Submission

Always verify your submission:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Check that your latest changes are visible
3. Look for the green checkmark on your commit
4. Check the timestamp (must be before deadline!)

:::{tip} 💡 Pro Tip: Push Early and Often

*Don't wait until 11:59 PM to push!* Push every time you make progress:

- Implemented a function? Push.
- Fixed a bug? Push.
- Added comments? Push.

This way you always have a submission, even if something goes wrong at the last minute.
:::

## Basic Git Workflow

Let's practice the complete workflow:

### Creating a New Repository

```bash
# Create project folder
mkdir my_analysis
cd my_analysis

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Create a Python file
echo "print('Hello ASTR 596!')" > hello.py

# Create a .gitignore file
cat > .gitignore << EOF
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
venv/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
.pytest_cache/

# Data files (usually too large)
*.fits
*.hdf5
*.npy
*.npz
data/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.Trash-*

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# Personal
scratch/
notes_to_self.txt
EOF

# Check status
git status

# Add everything
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "Initial commit with hello.py and .gitignore"
```

### Daily Workflow Cycle

```bash
# Start of work session
git pull                     # Get latest changes (if working with others)

# ... do your work ...

git status                    # What changed?
git diff                      # See specific changes
git add .                     # Stage everything
git commit -m "Clear message" # Save snapshot
git push                      # Backup to cloud
```

## Writing Good Commit Messages

:::{tip} 📝 Commit Message Best Practices

**Good messages** explain what and why:

- "Fix energy conservation bug in leapfrog integrator"
- "Add mass-luminosity relationship for main sequence stars"
- "Optimize N-body force calculation with spatial hashing"

**Bad messages** are vague or useless:

- "Fixed stuff"
- "asdfasdf"
- "done"
- "why won't this work"

Future you will thank current you for clear messages!
:::

### Commit Message Format

For longer commits:

```bash
git commit
# Opens editor for multi-line message:

# Fix incorrect gravitational constant in N-body simulation
#
# The constant was off by a factor of 4π due to unit conversion
# error. This affected all orbital period calculations.
# 
# Fixes #12
```

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### "I Forgot to Pull First"

```bash
git push
# Error: failed to push some refs...

# Solution:
git pull
# If there are conflicts, resolve them (see below)
git push
```

### "I Made a Mistake in My Last Commit"

```bash
# Fix the file
# Then amend the commit
git add .
git commit --amend -m "New message"
git push --force  # Only if you already pushed!
```

### "I Need to Undo Changes"

```bash
# Discard changes to specific file (not staged)
git checkout -- file.py

# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Nuclear option: discard ALL local changes
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### Merge Conflicts

When Git can't automatically merge:

1. Git marks conflicts in files:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

2. Edit file to resolve:

```python
# Keep the version you want (or combine them)
combined final version
```

3. Complete the merge:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
git push
```

## Troubleshooting

```{admonition} 🔧 Common Issues and Fixes
:class: dropdown

**"Permission denied (publickey)"**
- You're using SSH but haven't set up keys
- Use HTTPS URLs instead: `https://github.com/...`
- Or set up SSH keys (see GitHub docs)

**"Authentication failed"**
- Personal Access Token issue
- Create new token following steps above
- Make sure to paste TOKEN, not password

**"Cannot push to repository"**
- Check you're in the right directory: `pwd`
- Verify remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Make sure you have commits: `git log`

**"Large files" error (>100MB)**
- Git won't accept huge files
- Add to `.gitignore`: `*.fits`, `*.hdf5`, etc.
- Use `git rm --cached largefile` to remove

**Accidentally committed sensitive data**
- DO NOT push yet!
- Remove with: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
- If already pushed, contact instructor immediately
```

## Beyond Basics: Useful Features

```{admonition} 🚀 Level Up Your Git Skills
:class: note, dropdown

**Stashing** (temporary storage):
```bash
git stash          # Save changes temporarily
git stash pop      # Restore changes
```

**Viewing specific commits**:
```bash
git show abc123    # Show specific commit
git diff HEAD~2    # Compare with 2 commits ago
```

**Finding bugs with bisect**:
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad      # Current version is broken
git bisect good v1.0  # v1.0 was working
# Git helps you find when bug was introduced
```

**Aliases for efficiency**:
```bash
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.cm commit
git config --global alias.br branch
# Now use: git st, git cm, etc.
```
```
