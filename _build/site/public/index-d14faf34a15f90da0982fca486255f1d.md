# Getting Started

**Your Foundation for Computational Astrophysics**
Before we model the universe, we need to set up our computational laboratory. This module establishes the professional development environment and essential skills you'll use throughout ASTR 596 and your research career.

:::{tip} Module Philosophy: Tools Shape Thinking

The difference between a computational scientist and someone who codes isn't knowledge of Python syntax‚Äîit's mastery of the ecosystem. Version control, environment management, and command-line fluency aren't just "nice to have" skills; they fundamentally change how you approach problems, collaborate, and think about reproducible science.

```

**Complete these guides in order**. Each builds on the previous:
1. **CLI first**: Learn to navigate before installing anything
2. **Setup second**: Use your CLI skills to install tools
3. **Git last**: Apply everything to manage your code

## Learning Path

```{admonition} üéØ Module Goals
:class: important

After completing this module in order, you will:

‚úÖ **Navigate** the terminal with confidence using pwd, ls, cd, and Tab completion  
‚úÖ **Have** a fully configured Python environment isolated from system Python  
‚úÖ **Understand** conda environments and why they prevent dependency conflicts  
‚úÖ **Use** Git for every assignment submission via GitHub Classroom  
‚úÖ **Debug** common issues independently using error messages  
‚úÖ **Appreciate** why every computational scientist relies on these tools daily
```

## Time Investment

::::{grid} 2 2 2 2

:::{grid-item}

## Common Challenges (and Solutions)

```{admonition} ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Hurdles
:class: warning

**Challenge 1: "The terminal is scary"**  
*Solution*: Start with just 3 commands (pwd, ls, cd). Everything else builds on these.

**Challenge 2: "Command not found" errors**  
*Solution*: Usually means wrong environment. Check for `(astr596)` in your prompt.

**Challenge 3: Git says "failed to push"**  
*Solution*: Someone else pushed first. Pull, resolve conflicts, then push.

**Challenge 4: "This doesn't work on Windows"**  
*Solution*: Use Git Bash for Unix-like commands. We've noted all platform differences.

**Challenge 5: "I accidentally deleted files with rm"**  
*Solution*: Why we emphasize backups and teach safe deletion practices first!
```

## Getting Help

```{admonition} üÜò Support Resources
:class: note

**Setup Issues**: 
- Read error messages carefully (they usually tell you what's wrong)
- Google the exact error message in quotes
- Check our troubleshooting sections in each guide
- Post on course Slack with: OS, command tried, full error

**Conceptual Questions**:
- Why do we need virtual environments?
- How does Git track changes?
- What's the difference between terminal and shell?
‚Üí Great office hours questions!

**Platform-Specific Issues**:
- Windows: Use Git Bash for Unix commands
- Mac: If commands fail, check if you need to install Xcode tools
- Linux: Usually works out of the box

**Remember**: Everyone struggles with setup. Once it's working, it just works.
```

## Module Completion

```{admonition} üéâ Success Indicators
:class: success

You're ready for Python Fundamentals when you can:

1. **Open terminal** and navigate to any folder using cd and ls
2. **Activate your environment** with `conda activate astr596`
3. **Create a Git repository**, make commits, and push to GitHub
4. **Run Python scripts** from the command line
5. **Fix basic issues** using error messages and documentation

If you can do these five things, you have the foundation for everything in this course!
```

## What's Next?

After completing this module, you'll begin the Python Fundamentals module where you'll:
- Write your first object-oriented stellar evolution model
- Use the terminal skills daily for running scripts
- Submit all work via Git and GitHub Classroom
- Build on this foundation for the rest of your career

```{admonition} How to Succeed in This Module
:class: tip

**Don't Rush**: Setup problems compound. Better to spend an extra hour now than fight your environment all semester.

**Practice Daily**: Spend 10 minutes each day using the terminal. Muscle memory develops quickly with consistent practice.

**Commit Often**: Make Git commits after every small success. You can't over-commit, but you can under-commit.

**Read Error Messages**: They usually tell you exactly what's wrong. Copy the full error when asking for help.

**Keep Notes**: Document what worked for your specific system. You'll need these notes again for future projects.

**Remember**: These tools aren't just course requirements‚Äîthey're essential skills for any scientific research career. The more you invest in mastering them now, the more prepared you'll be for real research challenges ahead.
