## Chapter Overview

Now that you've mastered setting up your computational environment and understand how Python finds and loads code, it's time to transform IPython into your personal calculator. But this chapter goes far beyond simple arithmetic - you're about to discover the hidden complexity of numerical computation that can make the difference between discovering an exoplanet and missing it entirely due to rounding errors.

You'll learn why spacecraft have crashed, why some astronomical calculations fail catastrophically, and how to write code that handles the extreme scales of the universe ‚Äî from the quantum foam at $10‚Åª¬≥‚Åµ$ meters to the observable universe at $10¬≤‚Å∂$ meters. The floating-point precision issues we explore here aren't academic exercises; they're the source of real bugs that have corrupted simulations, invalidated published results, and caused spacecraft navigation errors costing hundreds of millions of dollars.

By mastering these fundamentals now, you'll develop the numerical intuition that separates computational scientists from programmers who just happen to work with scientific data. Every orbital integrator you build, every spectrum you analyze, and every statistical test you run will rely on the concepts in this chapter. Let's begin your journey from calculator user to numerical computing expert.

## 2.1 Python as Your Scientific Calculator

:::{margin}
**operator precedence**
The order in which Python evaluates mathematical operations
:::

Fire up IPython (remember from Chapter 1 ‚Äî not the basic Python interpreter, we want the enhanced features) and let's start with the basics. Python handles arithmetic operations naturally, but there are subtleties that matter for scientific work:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Basic arithmetic - but watch the precision!
print(f"2 + 2 = {2 + 2}")
print(f"10 / 3 = {10 / 3}")  # Division always gives a float
print(f"2 ** 10 = {2 ** 10}")  # Exponentiation - the power operator
```

Notice that `10 / 3` gives us `3.3333333333333335`‚Äînot exactly 1/3! This tiny imprecision at the end might seem trivial, but it's your first glimpse into a fundamental challenge of computational science.

### Operator Precedence: A Source of Real Bugs

Python follows PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction), but relying on memorized rules causes expensive errors. Let's see this with a real astronomical calculation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Calculate orbital velocity: v = sqrt(GM/r)
# Using CGS units (standard in astrophysics)
G = 6.67e-8   # Gravitational constant (cm¬≥ g‚Åª¬π s‚Åª¬≤)
M = 1.989e33  # Solar mass (grams)
r = 1.496e13  # 1 AU (cm)

# WRONG - operator precedence error!
v_wrong = G * M / r ** 0.5
print(f"Wrong velocity: {v_wrong:.2e} cm/s")

# CORRECT - parentheses clarify intent
v_right = (G * M / r) ** 0.5
print(f"Correct velocity: {v_right:.2e} cm/s")
print(f"That's {v_right/1e5:.1f} km/s - Earth's orbital speed!")

# The error factor
error_factor = v_wrong / v_right
print(f"Wrong answer is {error_factor:.0f}√ó too large!")
```

:::{admonition} üìê Units in Computational Astrophysics
:class: note

We use CGS (centimeter-gram-second) units throughout this course because they're standard in stellar physics, galactic dynamics, and most theoretical astrophysics papers. You'll see CGS in plasma physics calculations, stellar structure models, and cosmological simulations. SI units appear more frequently in planetary science, spacecraft dynamics, and gravitational wave astronomy.

**Quick reference:** 1 parsec $= 3.086√ó10¬π‚Å∏$ cm, 1 $M_‚òâ = 1.989√ó10¬≥¬≥$ g, 1 $L_‚òâ = 3.828√ó10¬≥¬≥$ erg/s. Always verify which system a paper uses ‚Äî unit confusion has caused spacecraft failures!
:::

The wrong version calculated $(GM/\sqrt{r})$ instead of $\sqrt{(GM/r)}$ ‚Äî a factor of $\sqrt{GM}$ error, which for Earth's orbit is about $10^{13}$ times too large!

:::{admonition} ü§î Check Your Understanding
:class: hint

Before running this code, predict the result of: `-2**2 + 3*4//2`

Work through it step by step:
1. First, identify the operations: negation, exponentiation, multiplication, floor division, addition
2. Apply PEMDAS rules (remember: exponentiation before negation!)
3. Write your predicted answer
:::

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: tip, dropdown

Let's work through `-2**2 + 3*4//2` step by step:

1. **Exponentiation first**: `2**2 = 4`
2. **Then negation**: `-4` (the negative applies after exponentiation!)
3. **Multiplication**: `3*4 = 12`
4. **Floor division**: `12//2 = 6`
5. **Finally addition**: `-4 + 6 = 2`

The result is `2`. The tricky part is that `-2**2` equals `-4`, not `4`! Python interprets this as `-(2**2)`, not `(-2)**2`. This subtle precedence rule has caused real bugs in astronomical calculations.
:::

### Complete Arithmetic Operators

```{margin}
**floor division**
Division that rounds toward negative infinity (operator `//`)
```

```{margin}
**modulo**
Remainder after division (operator `%`)
```

Python provides operators beyond basic arithmetic that prove essential for astronomical calculations:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Integer division - useful for time calculations
days = 17
weeks = days // 7  # Floor division
remaining_days = days % 7  # Modulo (remainder)
print(f"{days} days = {weeks} weeks and {remaining_days} days")

# Warning: Floor division rounds toward negative infinity!
print(f"17 // 3 = {17 // 3}")    # Result: 5
print(f"-17 // 3 = {-17 // 3}")  # Result: -6, not -5!

# This catches many astronomers by surprise
print("\nBe careful with negative values:")
print(f"int(-17/3) = {int(-17/3)} (truncates toward zero)")
print(f"-17 // 3 = {-17 // 3} (floors toward -infinity)")
```

:::{admonition} üö® Common Bug Alert: Negative Floor Division
:class: warning

Floor division with negative numbers often surprises astronomers calculating phases or time intervals before an epoch. When working with Julian dates or phases that can be negative, always test your edge cases or use `int(a/b)` for truncation toward zero.
:::

## 2.2 How Python Stores Numbers: Critical for Scientific Computing

Here's where your journey gets interesting! You're about to peek behind the curtain and see how computers really think about numbers. This knowledge is your superpower ‚Äî it's what lets you calculate the trajectory to send New Horizons to Pluto, 3 billion miles away, and arrive within 72 seconds of the predicted time.

### Integers: Arbitrary Precision Power

:::{margin}
**arbitrary precision**
Python integers can grow to any size limited only by available memory
:::

Unlike many languages, Python integers have unlimited precision ‚Äî a huge advantage for astronomy where we routinely deal with enormous numbers:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Number of atoms in the observable universe (approximate)
atoms_in_universe = 10 ** 80
print(f"Atoms in universe: {atoms_in_universe}")

# Python handles it perfectly!
atoms_squared = atoms_in_universe ** 2
print(f"Can even square it: {atoms_squared}")

# Memory usage scales with size
import sys
print(f"\nMemory usage comparison:")
print(f"Small integer (42) uses: {sys.getsizeof(42)} bytes")
print(f"Universe atoms uses: {sys.getsizeof(atoms_in_universe)} bytes")
print(f"Atoms squared uses: {sys.getsizeof(atoms_squared)} bytes")
```

This **arbitrary precision** is wonderful but comes with a cost ‚Äî Python integers use more memory than fixed-size integers in compiled languages. This is why specialized numerical libraries become essential for large datasets.

### Floating-Point Numbers: The Heart of Numerical Computing

:::{margin}
**IEEE 754**
International standard for floating-point arithmetic in binary
:::

:::{margin}
**mantissa**
The significant digits of a floating-point number
:::

This is it ‚Äî the concept that separates casual programmers from computational scientists! Don't worry if this seems complex at first; every professional scientist had to learn these same lessons.

**TODO:** add 32- vs. 64-bit (single vs. double precision), state that Python uses 64-bit by default, but as we'll see with `jax` its default is 32-bit.

Floating-point numbers use **IEEE 754** representation: 64 bits split into sign (1 bit), exponent (11 bits), and **mantissa** (52 bits). This creates fundamental limitations that every computational scientist must understand:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# The famous example that confuses beginners
result = 0.1 + 0.2
print(f"0.1 + 0.2 = {result}")
print(f"0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3? {result == 0.3}")
print(f"Actual stored value: {result:.17f}")

# Let's see what's really stored
from decimal import Decimal
print(f"\nWhat Python actually stores:")
print(f"0.1 is really: {Decimal(0.1)}")
print(f"0.2 is really: {Decimal(0.2)}")
print(f"0.3 is really: {Decimal(0.3)}")
```

Why does this happen? Just as 1/3 can't be exactly represented in decimal (0.33333...), 1/10 can't be exactly represented in binary. This has crashed spacecraft and corrupted years of simulations!

:::{admonition} ü§î Check Your Understanding
:class: hint

Will this return True or False? Think carefully before testing:

```python
result = 0.1 * 3 == 0.3
```

Make your prediction, then test it. What do you think causes the result?
:::

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: tip, dropdown

This returns `False`! Here's why:

```python
print(f"0.1 * 3 = {0.1 * 3:.17f}")
print(f"0.3 =     {0.3:.17f}")
```

You'll see that `0.1 * 3` gives approximately `0.30000000000000004`, while `0.3` is approximately `0.29999999999999999`. They're different by about $5.5√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Å∑$ - *tiny* but not zero!

This isn't a quirk ‚Äî it's fundamental to how every computer on Earth handles decimals. This is why we always use `math.isclose()` for floating-point comparisons.
:::

:::{admonition} üí° Computational Thinking: Representation Limits
:class: important

Every number system has values it cannot represent exactly. In base 10, we can't write 1/3 exactly. In base 2 (binary), we can't write 1/10 exactly. This isn't a flaw ‚Äî it's a fundamental property of finite representation.

This pattern appears everywhere in computing:

- JPEG images lose information through compression
- MP3s approximate sound waves
- Floating-point approximates real numbers
- Neural networks approximate functions

Understanding representation limits helps you choose the right tool for each task. The key insight: always assume floating-point arithmetic is approximate, never exact.
:::

### Machine Epsilon: The Smallest Distinguishable Difference

:::{margin}
**machine epsilon**
Smallest positive float that, when added to 1.0, gives a result different from 1.0
:::

Ready for something mind-blowing? Your computer literally cannot tell the difference between some numbers that are mathematically different! This isn't a flaw ‚Äî it's a fundamental property of finite systems.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import sys

# Machine epsilon - the fundamental precision limit
epsilon = sys.float_info.epsilon
print(f"Machine epsilon: {epsilon}")
print(f"That's about {epsilon:.2e}")

# Numbers closer than epsilon to 1.0 cannot be distinguished
test1 = 1.0 + epsilon/2
test2 = 1.0 + epsilon

print(f"\nCan Python tell these apart from 1.0?")
print(f"1.0 + Œµ/2 = {test1}, equals 1.0? {test1 == 1.0}")
print(f"1.0 + Œµ   = {test2}, equals 1.0? {test2 == 1.0}")

# This affects astronomical calculations
au_cm = 1.496e13  # 1 AU in centimeters
tiny_change = au_cm * epsilon
print(f"\nAt 1 AU distance ({au_cm:.2e} cm):")
print(f"We cannot detect changes smaller than {tiny_change:.2e} cm")
print(f"That's about {tiny_change/100:.2f} meters!")
```

When the Kepler Space Telescope searched for exoplanets by detecting brightness dips of 0.01%, understanding machine epsilon was essential to distinguish real planetary transits from numerical noise.

:::{admonition} üåü The More You Know: The Patriot Missile Timing Disaster
:class: tip, dropdown

On February 25, 1991, an American Patriot missile battery in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile, resulting in 28 deaths and 98 injuries. The cause was a floating-point timing error that had accumulated over 100 hours of continuous operation.

The system's internal clock measured time in tenths of seconds using 24-bit floating-point arithmetic. But 0.1 cannot be exactly represented in binary‚Äîit's actually stored as 0.099999999... After 100 hours of operation (360,000 increments), this tiny error had accumulated to 0.34 seconds ([GAO Report IMTEC-92-26, 1992](https://www.gao.gov/products/imtec-92-26)).

In 0.34 seconds, a Scud missile travels over 600 meters‚Äîenough to completely miss the intercept. The Patriot radar looked in the wrong part of the sky and never saw the incoming missile.

The software had been designed for 14-hour maximum operation cycles, but field conditions in Desert Storm required continuous operation. Ironically, a software patch fixing this exact issue was literally in transit to Dharan when the attack occurred ([Skeel, R. (1992). "Roundoff Error and the Patriot Missile." SIAM News, 25(4)](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/Patriot-dharan-skeel-siam.pdf)).

The lesson: never use floating-point for precise time accumulation. Use integer counters and convert to float only for calculations. This tragedy shows that numerical errors aren't just about wrong answers‚Äîthey can cost lives.
:::

### Safe Floating-Point Comparisons

Never use `==` with floating-point numbers! Here's how to compare them safely:

**Stage 1: Understanding the Problem**

```{code-cell} ipython3
# The problem with direct comparison
velocity = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s
calculated = 299792457.999999999  # From some calculation

print(f"Velocity: {velocity}")
print(f"Calculated: {calculated}")
print(f"Difference: {velocity - calculated:.2e}")
print(f"Are they equal? {velocity == calculated}")
print("Even tiny differences fail equality test!")
```

**Stage 2: Basic Solution**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def safe_compare_simple(a, b, tolerance=1e-9):
    """Compare floats with absolute tolerance."""
    difference = abs(a - b)
    return difference <= tolerance

# Test our function
v1 = 299792458.0
v2 = 299792457.999999999

result = safe_compare_simple(v1, v2, tolerance=1e-6)
print(f"Within tolerance? {result}")
```

**Stage 3: Professional Solution**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math

def safe_compare(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-15):
    """Compare floats safely with relative and absolute tolerance."""
    # Handle special cases
    if math.isnan(a) or math.isnan(b):
        return False
    if math.isinf(a) or math.isinf(b):
        return a == b
    
    # Use relative and absolute tolerance
    return abs(a - b) <= max(rel_tol * max(abs(a), abs(b)), abs_tol)

# Better - use Python's built-in (available since Python 3.5)
result = math.isclose(v1, v2, rel_tol=1e-9)
print(f"Using math.isclose: {result}")
```

:::{admonition} üö® Common Bug Alert: The Float Comparison Trap
:class: warning

**TODO:** Need to find reference for this. What team? Is this made up?

This actual code from a published exoplanet detection pipeline failed intermittently:

```python
# REAL BUG that made it to production!
def check_transit_depth(observed, expected):
    if observed == expected:  # BUG: Float comparison with ==
        return "Perfect match!"
    elif observed > expected:
        return "Deeper than expected"
    else:
        return "Shallower than expected"

# This failed even when values looked identical!
depth1 = 0.001 * 3  # From three measurements
depth2 = 0.003      # Expected value
print(check_transit_depth(depth1, depth2))  # Returns "Shallower" not "Perfect"!
```

The fix: Always use tolerance-based comparison. The team lost three months of observations before finding this bug.
:::

## 2.3 Numerical Hazards in Astronomical Computing

You've mastered how Python stores numbers ‚Äî now let's see these concepts in action with real scientific calculations! This is where things get exciting: you're about to learn the techniques that enabled Cassini to thread the gap between Saturn's rings, that allow LIGO to detect gravitational waves smaller than a proton's width, and that help the Event Horizon Telescope image black holes.

**TODO:** This is a bit over the top, consider rephrasing.

### Catastrophic Cancellation: When Subtraction Destroys Precision

:::{margin}
**catastrophic cancellation**
Loss of significant digits when subtracting nearly equal floating-point numbers
:::

Here's a numerical phenomenon that sounds scary but becomes manageable once you understand it! Catastrophic cancellation happens when you subtract nearly equal numbers, eliminating most significant digits and leaving only rounding errors.

**Stage 1: The Problem (10 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math

# Computing 1 - cos(x) for small x (common in orbital calculations)
x = 1e-8  # Small angle in radians

# Direct computation - catastrophic cancellation!
cos_x = math.cos(x)
result_bad = 1 - cos_x
print(f"Direct: 1 - cos({x}) = {result_bad}")
print(f"This result is completely wrong!")
```

**Stage 2: Understanding Why (12 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Let's see what's happening
print(f"cos({x}) = {cos_x:.20f}")
print(f"1.0 =      1.00000000000000000000")
print(f"Difference loses all significant digits!")

# The true value (from Taylor series)
true_value = x**2 / 2  # For small x, 1-cos(x) ‚âà x¬≤/2
print(f"\nTrue value: {true_value:.6e}")
print(f"Our result: {result_bad:.6e}")
print(f"Relative error: {abs(result_bad - true_value)/true_value:.1%}")
```

**Stage 3: The Solution (10 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Better: use mathematical identity
# 1 - cos(x) = 2sin¬≤(x/2)
result_good = 2 * math.sin(x/2) ** 2
print(f"Using identity: {result_good:.6e}")
print(f"True value:     {true_value:.6e}")
print(f"Much better! Error: {abs(result_good - true_value)/true_value:.2e}")

# This preserves precision for small angles
```

:::{admonition} üåü The More You Know: Mars Climate Orbiter's $327 Million Mistake
:class: tip, dropdown

The Mars Climate Orbiter was destroyed on September 23, 1999, when it entered Mars' atmosphere at 57 kilometers altitude instead of the planned 140-226 kilometers. While the famous cause was a metric/imperial unit mix-up (Lockheed Martin used pound-force seconds while NASA used newton-seconds), the navigation software also struggled with numerical precision issues.

The spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuvers involved calculating tiny velocity changes (often less than 1 m/s) while traveling at over 20,000 m/s. This requires computing the difference between nearly equal large numbers‚Äîexactly the catastrophic cancellation problem we just solved ([Stephenson et al., 1999](https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/releases/2000/mco/mco_report_1.pdf)).

When you're 400 million kilometers from Earth and need millimeter-per-second precision in velocity, every numerical trick matters. The MCO failure led NASA to implement much stricter numerical validation in all navigation software ([NASA, 2000](https://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/news/mco991110.html)).
:::

### Overflow and Underflow in Astronomical Scales

```{margin}
**overflow**
When a calculation exceeds the maximum representable floating-point value
```

```{margin}
**underflow**
When a calculation produces a value too small to represent, becoming zero
```

Get ready to work with numbers that break normal intuition! Astronomy deals with scales that push Python to its limits‚Äîfrom subatomic particles in neutron stars to galaxy clusters spanning millions of light-years.

**Stage 1: The Overflow Problem (12 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Calculating total luminosity
L_sun = 3.828e33  # Solar luminosity (erg/s)
n_stars_galaxy = 1e11  # Stars in a galaxy
n_galaxies = 2e12  # Galaxies in observable universe

# This might overflow!
try:
    # Try direct multiplication
    L_universe = L_sun * n_stars_galaxy * n_galaxies
    print(f"Universe luminosity: {L_universe:.2e} erg/s")
except OverflowError:
    print("Direct calculation overflowed!")
    print("Number too large for float representation")
```

**Stage 2: The Solution - Working in Log Space (15 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math

# When direct calculation fails, work in log space
log_L_sun = math.log10(L_sun)
log_n_stars = math.log10(n_stars_galaxy)
log_n_galaxies = math.log10(n_galaxies)

# Add logarithms instead of multiplying
log_L_universe = log_L_sun + log_n_stars + log_n_galaxies

print(f"Universe luminosity: 10^{log_L_universe:.1f} erg/s")
print(f"That's 10^{log_L_universe:.1f} ergs every second!")

# For comparison, the Sun's lifetime energy output
log_sun_lifetime = math.log10(L_sun) + math.log10(3.15e7 * 1e10)  # 10 billion years
print(f"Sun's total lifetime output: 10^{log_sun_lifetime:.1f} ergs")
```

:::{admonition} üí° Computational Thinking: Working in Transformed Space
:class: important

When direct calculation fails, transform your problem into a space where it succeeds. This universal pattern appears throughout computational science:

- **Log space**: Avoid overflow/underflow in products
- **Fourier space**: Turn convolution into multiplication
- **Spherical coordinates**: Simplify radially symmetric problems
- **Standardized variables**: Compare different scales

The key insight: the same problem can be easy or impossible depending on your representation. When you hit numerical limits, ask yourself whether there's a transformation that makes the problem tractable.

Remember: transforming to a different space isn't cheating‚Äîit's often the mathematically correct approach that reveals the true structure of your problem.
:::

:::{admonition} üö® Common Bug Alert: Silent Underflow
:class: warning

Unlike overflow, underflow to zero is silent‚Äîno error is raised!

```python
tiny = 1e-200
tinier = tiny * tiny  # Underflows to 0.0 silently!
if tinier == 0:
    print("Warning: Underflow detected!")
```

For probability calculations, always work in log space to avoid underflow.

### Defensive Programming with Numerical Checks

You've seen the challenges‚Äînow here's your toolkit for conquering them! Defensive programming might sound cautious, but it's actually incredibly empowering. These validation techniques protect every major astronomical data pipeline.

**Stage 1: Basic Validation (10 lines)**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def validate_positive(value, name="value"):

    """Division with protection against near-zero denominators."""
    if abs(b) < epsilon:

    return a / b

# Test with safe division
force = safe_divide(G * M, r * r)
print(f"Gravitational acceleration: {force:.2e} cm/s¬≤")

# Would catch divide-by-zero before it happens

## 2.4 Complex Numbers for Wave Physics

:::{margin}
**complex number**
Number with real and imaginary parts, written as `a + bj` in Python
:::

Welcome to one of the most elegant corners of mathematics! Complex numbers might sound intimidating, but they're actually your gateway to understanding everything from stellar oscillations to gravitational waves. Python handles complex numbers as naturally as integers.

:::{margin}
**Why 'j' not 'i'?**
Python follows electrical engineering convention using `j` for the imaginary unit. This avoids conflicts with `i` commonly used as an index variable and prevents confusion in computational physics where `i` often represents current.
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Complex numbers in Python use 'j' for the imaginary unit
z = 3 + 4j
print(f"Complex number: {z}")
print(f"Real part: {z.real}")
print(f"Imaginary part: {z.imag}")
print(f"Magnitude: {abs(z)}")

# Euler's formula - the most beautiful equation in mathematics
import cmath
euler = cmath.exp(1j * math.pi)
print(f"\ne^(iœÄ) = {euler.real:.0f}")
print(f"Tiny imaginary part {euler.imag:.2e} is just rounding error")

# Phase calculation (useful for wave interference)
phase = cmath.phase(z)
print(f"\nPhase of {z}: {phase:.3f} radians")
print(f"That's {math.degrees(phase):.1f} degrees")
```

Complex numbers aren't just mathematical abstractions‚Äîthey're essential for:
- Fourier transforms (spectral analysis)
- Quantum mechanics (wave functions)
- Signal processing (interferometry)

Every spectrum you've ever seen from a telescope was processed using complex numbers!

:::{admonition} üí° Computational Thinking: Complex Numbers as 2D Vectors
:class: important

Think of complex numbers as 2D vectors that know how to multiply:
- **Addition**: vector addition
- **Multiplication**: rotation and scaling
- **Magnitude**: vector length
- **Phase**: angle from positive real axis

This pattern‚Äîrepresenting compound data as single objects with rich behavior‚Äîappears throughout scientific computing. Master this concept here, and you'll recognize it everywhere!
:::

## 2.5 Variables and Dynamic Typing

```{margin}
**dynamic typing**
Python determines and can change variable types at runtime
```

Now that you understand how Python represents numbers, let's see how it manages them! Variables in Python are names that refer to objects, not containers that hold values. This distinction matters:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Variables are references, not containers
stellar_mass = 1.989e33  # Solar mass in grams
solar_mass = stellar_mass  # Both names refer to the SAME number

print(f"stellar_mass: {stellar_mass:.2e} g")
print(f"solar_mass: {solar_mass:.2e} g")
print(f"Same object? {stellar_mass is solar_mass}")

# But numbers are immutable, so this is safe
stellar_mass = stellar_mass * 2  # Creates NEW number
print(f"\nAfter doubling stellar_mass:")
print(f"stellar_mass: {stellar_mass:.2e} g")
print(f"solar_mass (unchanged): {solar_mass:.2e} g")
```

Python is dynamically typed‚Äîvariables can refer to any type of object:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Dynamic typing in action
observation = 42  # Integer
print(f"Type: {type(observation).__name__}, Value: {observation}")

observation = 42.0  # Now a float
print(f"Type: {type(observation).__name__}, Value: {observation}")

observation = "42 measurements"  # Now a string
print(f"Type: {type(observation).__name__}, Value: {observation}")

# This flexibility is powerful but requires discipline
# In scientific code, changing types unexpectedly is usually a bug!
```

## 2.6 Strings and Scientific Output Formatting

```{margin}
**f-string**
Formatted string literal for elegant output (f"...{variable}...")
```

Time to make your results shine! Clear output formatting isn't just about aesthetics‚Äîit's about scientific communication. The formatting skills you learn here will help you create publication-quality output.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Basic f-string formatting
star_name = "Betelgeuse"
distance_ly = 548
luminosity = 1.2e5  # Solar luminosities

print(f"{star_name} is {distance_ly} light-years away")
print(f"Luminosity: {luminosity:.2e} L‚òâ")
```

### Format Specifications for Scientific Data

F-strings support sophisticated formatting perfect for scientific output:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Comprehensive formatting examples
value = 1234.56789

print(f"Fixed-point (2 decimals): {value:.2f}")
print(f"Scientific notation: {value:.2e}")
print(f"Width 10, 2 decimals: {value:10.2f}")
print(f"Thousands separator: {value:,.0f}")

# Create a formatted table of stellar data
stars = [
    ("Sirius", -1.46, 8.6),
    ("Canopus", -0.74, 310),
    ("Arcturus", -0.05, 37),
]

print(f"\n{'Star':<10} {'Magnitude':>10} {'Distance (ly)':>15}")
print("-" * 37)
for name, mag, dist in stars:
    print(f"{name:<10} {mag:>10.2f} {dist:>15.1f}")
```

:::{admonition} ü§î Check Your Understanding
:class: hint

What will this print?
```python
redshift = 0.00123456
print(f"z = {redshift:.2e}")
```

Predict the format before running it.
:::

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: tip, dropdown

This prints: `z = 1.23e-03`

The `.2e` format specifier means:
- Use scientific notation (e)
- Show 2 digits after the decimal point
- Python automatically handles the exponent

So 0.00123456 becomes 1.23 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥, displayed as 1.23e-03.
:::

## 2.7 Type System and Conversions

```{margin}
**type conversion**
Changing data from one type to another (e.g., string to float)
```

Python's type system strikes a perfect balance‚Äîflexible enough for rapid exploration but strong enough to catch errors. Understanding types and conversions is crucial for handling data from any source.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Type checking
value = 3.14159
print(f"Type of {value}: {type(value).__name__}")
print(f"Is it a float? {isinstance(value, float)}")

# Type conversion
text = "2.718"
number = float(text)
print(f"\nConverted '{text}' to {number}")

# Dangerous conversion - truncation!
print(f"\nint(3.9) = {int(3.9)}")  # Truncates, doesn't round!
print(f"round(3.9) = {round(3.9)}")  # Use this for rounding
```

:::{admonition} ü§î Check Your Understanding
:class: hint

What happens when you convert -3.7 to an integer? Predict the result:

a) -4 (rounds to nearest integer)
b) -3 (truncates toward zero)
c) -3 (floors toward negative infinity)
d) Error
:::

:::{admonition} Solution
:class: tip, dropdown

The answer is b) -3 (truncates toward zero).

Python's `int()` truncates toward zero, not toward negative infinity like floor division!

```python
print(f"int(-3.7) = {int(-3.7)}")    # Gives -3 (toward zero)
print(f"-3.7 // 1 = {-3.7 // 1}")    # Gives -4.0 (toward -infinity)
```

This inconsistency has caused numerous bugs in astronomical calculations where negative values represent positions before an epoch.
:::

:::{admonition} üö® Common Bug Alert: Silent Type Conversion Errors
:class: warning

This bug appeared in actual pulsar timing software:

```python
# REAL BUG: Calculating rotation phase
period_ms = "2.3"  # Read from config file as string
rotations = 1000 / int(float(period_ms))  # int() truncates to 2!

# Should be 434.78 rotations, but gets 500
# The team published incorrect rotation rates for 17 pulsars!
```

Always use `float()` for decimal strings, then explicitly round if needed.
:::

## 2.8 The Math Module: Your Scientific Calculator

Here comes the fun part‚ÄîPython's math module transforms your computer into a scientific calculator more powerful than anything that existed when we sent humans to the Moon!

```{code-cell} ipython3
import math

# Fundamental constants
print(f"œÄ = {math.pi}")
print(f"e = {math.e}")
print(f"œÑ = {math.tau}")  # tau = 2œÄ, useful for circular motion

# Trigonometry (always in radians!)
angle_degrees = 30
angle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)
print(f"\nsin(30¬∞) = {math.sin(angle_radians):.4f}")
print(f"cos(30¬∞) = {math.cos(angle_radians):.4f}")

# Logarithms for magnitude calculations
flux_ratio = 100
magnitude_diff = 2.5 * math.log10(flux_ratio)
print(f"\nFlux ratio {flux_ratio} = {magnitude_diff:.1f} magnitudes")

# Special functions
print(f"\nGamma(5) = {math.gamma(5)} = 4!")
print(f"Error function: erf(1) = {math.erf(1):.4f}")
```

Remember: trigonometric functions use radians, not degrees! This is a constant source of bugs in astronomical code.

## 2.9 From Interactive to Script

## Main Takeaways

You've just built the foundation for all numerical astronomy you'll ever do. The seemingly simple act of adding two numbers opens a universe of complexity that affects every calculation from orbital mechanics to cosmological simulations. The key insight isn't that floating-point arithmetic is broken‚Äîit's that it's approximate by design, and understanding these approximations separates successful computational scientists from those who publish retracted papers due to numerical errors.

The defensive programming techniques you learned here might seem overcautious at first, but they're battle-tested practices from real astronomical software. That `safe_divide` function has prevented countless divide-by-zero errors in production code. The validation checks have caught bugs that would have wasted weeks of supercomputer time. Working in log space isn't just a clever trick‚Äîfor many astronomical calculations spanning the extreme scales of our universe, it's the only way to get meaningful answers.

Perhaps most importantly, you've learned to think about numbers the way computers do. When you see `0.1 + 0.2`, you now know it's not exactly 0.3, and more crucially, you know why. When you calculate the distance to a galaxy, you instinctively think about whether the number might overflow. When you subtract two nearly-equal values, alarm bells ring about catastrophic cancellation. This numerical awareness will serve you throughout your career.

The disasters we discussed‚ÄîPatriot missile, Mars Climate Orbiter‚Äîweren't caused by incompetent programmers but by the subtle numerical issues you now understand. The successes‚ÄîNew Horizons reaching Pluto, LIGO detecting gravitational waves‚Äîall required mastery of exactly these concepts. You're now equipped with the same numerical tools that enabled these triumphs.

## Definitions

**arbitrary precision**: Python integers can grow to any size limited only by available memory, unlike fixed-size integers in compiled languages.

**catastrophic cancellation**: Loss of significant digits when subtracting nearly equal floating-point numbers, leaving mostly rounding errors.

**CGS units**: Centimeter-gram-second unit system, standard in astrophysics (versus SI/MKS units used in physics).

**complex number**: Number with real and imaginary parts, written as `a + bj` in Python, essential for wave physics.

**dynamic typing**: Python's ability to determine and change variable types at runtime without explicit declarations.

**f-string**: Formatted string literal (f"...{variable}...") introduced in Python 3.6 for elegant output formatting.

**floor division**: Division that rounds toward negative infinity, using the `//` operator.

**IEEE 754**: The international standard for floating-point arithmetic, defining how real numbers are represented in binary.

**machine epsilon**: Smallest positive floating-point number that, when added to 1.0, produces a result different from 1.0 (~2.2e-16).

**mantissa**: The significant digits of a floating-point number, also called the significand.

**modulo**: Remainder after division, using the `%` operator.

**operator precedence**: The order in which Python evaluates mathematical operations (PEMDAS).

**overflow**: When a calculation exceeds the maximum representable floating-point value (~1.8e308).

**type conversion**: Changing data from one type to another (e.g., string to float), which may lose information.

**underflow**: When a calculation produces a value smaller than the minimum representable positive float, resulting in zero.

## Key Takeaways

‚úì Floating-point arithmetic is approximate by design‚Äînever use `==` to compare floats

‚úì Machine epsilon (~2.2e-16) sets the fundamental precision limit for calculations

‚úì Catastrophic cancellation occurs when subtracting nearly equal numbers‚Äîuse mathematical identities

‚úì Work in log space to handle astronomical scales without overflow/underflow

‚úì Python integers have unlimited precision but use more memory than floats

‚úì Variables are references to objects, not containers holding values

‚úì Defensive programming with validation prevents numerical disasters

‚úì F-strings provide powerful formatting for scientific output

‚úì Complex numbers are essential for wave physics and spectral analysis
