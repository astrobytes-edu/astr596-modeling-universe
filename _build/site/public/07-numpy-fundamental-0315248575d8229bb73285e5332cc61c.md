# Chapter 7: NumPy - The Foundation of Scientific Computing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create and manipulate NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computation
- Apply vectorized operations to eliminate explicit loops and improve performance by 10-100x
- Master array indexing, slicing, and boolean masking for data selection and filtering
- Understand and leverage broadcasting rules to perform operations on arrays of different shapes
- Use essential NumPy functions for scientific computing (linspace, logspace, where, meshgrid)
- Perform array transformations including reshaping, stacking, and splitting for data analysis
- Apply NumPy to real astronomical calculations with proper CGS units
- Recognize when to use NumPy instead of pure Python for numerical tasks

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting this chapter, verify you can:
- ✓ Work with Python lists and list comprehensions (Chapter 4)
- ✓ Use the math module for mathematical operations (Chapter 2)
- ✓ Understand functions and return values (Chapter 5)
- ✓ Work with nested data structures (Chapter 4)
- ✓ Import and use modules (Chapter 5)

Quick diagnostic:
```{code-cell} python
import math

# Can you predict what this code does?
data = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
result = [math.sqrt(x) for x in data]
print(result)

# What about this?
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
flattened = [item for row in matrix for item in row]
print(flattened)
```

If you understood both operations, you're ready to see how NumPy makes these operations both faster and cleaner!

## Chapter Overview

You've been using Python lists to store collections of numbers, and the math module to perform calculations. But what happens when you need to analyze a million stellar spectra, each with thousands of wavelength points? Or when you need to perform the same calculation on every pixel in a telescope image? Try using a list comprehension on a million-element list, and you'll be waiting a while. This is where NumPy transforms Python from a general-purpose language into a powerhouse for scientific computing, providing the speed and tools necessary for research-grade computational science.

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the foundation upon which the entire scientific Python ecosystem is built. Every plot you'll make with Matplotlib, every optimization you'll run with SciPy, every dataframe you'll analyze with Pandas – they all build on NumPy arrays. But NumPy isn't just about speed; it's about expressing mathematical operations naturally. Instead of writing loops to add corresponding elements of two lists, you simply write `a + b`. Instead of nested loops for matrix multiplication, you write `a @ b`. This isn't just convenience – it's a fundamental shift in how you think about numerical computation, from operating on individual elements to operating on entire arrays at once.

This chapter introduces you to NumPy's ndarray (n-dimensional array), the object that makes scientific Python possible. You'll discover why NumPy arrays are 10-100 times faster than Python lists for numerical operations, and how vectorization eliminates the need for most explicit loops. You'll master broadcasting, NumPy's powerful mechanism for operating on arrays of different shapes, which enables elegant solutions to complex problems. Most importantly, you'll learn to think in arrays – a skill that transforms you from someone who writes code that processes data to someone who writes code that expresses mathematical ideas directly. By the end, you'll understand why virtually every astronomical software package, from data reduction pipelines to cosmological simulations, is built on NumPy's foundation.

## 7.1 From Lists to Arrays: Why NumPy?

{margin} **NumPy**
A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

{margin} **ndarray**
NumPy's n-dimensional array object, the core data structure for numerical computation.

Let's start with a problem you already know how to solve, then see how NumPy transforms it. Imagine you're analyzing brightness measurements from a variable star:

```{code-cell} python
import time
import math

# Python list approach (what you know)
magnitudes = [12.3, 12.5, 12.4, 12.7, 12.6] * 20000  # 100,000 measurements
fluxes = []

start = time.perf_counter()
for mag in magnitudes:
    flux = 10**(-mag/2.5)  # Convert magnitude to relative flux
    fluxes.append(flux)
list_time = time.perf_counter() - start

print(f"List approach: {list_time*1000:.2f} ms")
print(f"First 5 fluxes: {fluxes[:5]}")
```

Now let's see the NumPy approach:

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np

# NumPy array approach (what you're learning)
magnitudes = np.array([12.3, 12.5, 12.4, 12.7, 12.6] * 20000)

start = time.perf_counter()
fluxes = 10**(-magnitudes/2.5)  # Operates on entire array at once!
numpy_time = time.perf_counter() - start

print(f"NumPy approach: {numpy_time*1000:.2f} ms")
print(f"Speedup: {list_time/numpy_time:.1f}x faster")
print(f"First 5 fluxes: {fluxes[:5]}")
```

The NumPy version is not only faster but also cleaner – no explicit loop needed! This is called **vectorization**, and it's the key to NumPy's power.

### NumPy vs. Math Module: A Complete Replacement

You've been using the math module for operations like `math.sin()`, `math.sqrt()`, and `math.log()`. Good news: NumPy can replace virtually all of math's functionality while adding array support:

```{code-cell} python
# Math module - works on single values only
import math
x = 2.0
math_result = math.sin(x)
print(f"math.sin({x}) = {math_result}")

# Try with a list - this fails!
# values = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# math.sin(values)  # TypeError!

# NumPy - works on single values AND arrays
x = 2.0
numpy_scalar_result = np.sin(x)
print(f"np.sin({x}) = {numpy_scalar_result}")

# NumPy shines with arrays
values = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
numpy_array_result = np.sin(values)
print(f"np.sin({values}) = {numpy_array_result}")

# NumPy has everything math has (and more)
print(f"\nComparison for x = {x}:")
print(f"  math.sqrt({x}) = {math.sqrt(x):.6f}")
print(f"  np.sqrt({x})   = {np.sqrt(x):.6f}")
print(f"  math.exp({x})  = {math.exp(x):.6f}")
print(f"  np.exp({x})    = {np.exp(x):.6f}")
print(f"  math.log10({x}) = {math.log10(x):.6f}")
print(f"  np.log10({x})   = {np.log10(x):.6f}")
```

**Key insight**: You can generally replace `import math` with `import numpy as np` and use NumPy for everything. The only exceptions are a few specialized functions like `math.factorial()` that don't have direct NumPy equivalents (though NumPy has `scipy.special.factorial()` if needed).

:::{admonition} 🎯 The More You Know: How NumPy Saved Gravitational Wave Astronomy
:class: note, story

On September 14, 2015, at 09:50:45 UTC, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves for the first time – ripples in spacetime from two black holes colliding 1.3 billion years ago. But this Nobel Prize-winning discovery almost didn't happen because of a computational bottleneck that NumPy solved.

LIGO's detectors produce 16,384 samples per second of incredibly noisy data. Detecting a gravitational wave requires comparing this data stream against hundreds of thousands of theoretical waveform templates using matched filtering. In 2009, the original C++ analysis pipeline took 24 hours to analyze just one hour of data – making real-time detection impossible.

Kipp Cannon, a LIGO scientist, made a radical decision: rewrite the entire pipeline in Python using NumPy. Critics were horrified. "Python is too slow for production!" they said. But Cannon understood something crucial: NumPy's vectorized operations call optimized C libraries (BLAS, LAPACK) that are often faster than hand-written C++ code.

The key transformation was replacing loops with NumPy operations:

```python
# Original approach (simplified)
def matched_filter_slow(data, template):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(data)):
        result += data[i] * template[i]
    return result

# NumPy approach
def matched_filter_fast(data, template):
    return np.dot(data, template)  # Or simply: data @ template
```

The NumPy version wasn't just cleaner – it was 50x faster! NumPy's FFT implementation (using FFTW under the hood) accelerated frequency-domain operations by another factor of 100. The complete Python/NumPy pipeline could analyze data faster than real-time, searching for gravitational waves as they arrived.

When GW150914 (the first detection) arrived, the NumPy-based pipeline identified it as a candidate within 3 minutes. The same analysis would have taken the original C++ code 72 minutes. Those 69 minutes made the difference between a live detection and a historical footnote. The discovery paper acknowledges NumPy explicitly: "The PyCBC analysis pipeline... makes extensive use of NumPy arrays and operations."

Today, every gravitational wave detection – from colliding neutron stars to intermediate-mass black holes – flows through NumPy arrays. The library you're learning didn't just speed up the analysis; it made an entirely new kind of astronomy possible. When you vectorize operations with NumPy, you're using the same technique that let humanity hear the universe for the first time!

## 7.2 Creating Arrays: Your Scientific Data Containers

{margin} **dtype**
Data type of array elements, controlling memory usage and precision.

NumPy provides many ways to create arrays, each suited for different scientific tasks:

```{code-cell} python
# From Python lists (most common starting point)
measurements = [23.5, 24.1, 23.8, 24.3]
arr = np.array(measurements)
print(f"From list: {arr}, dtype: {arr.dtype}")

# Specify data type for memory efficiency
counts = np.array([1000, 2000, 1500], dtype=np.int32)
print(f"Integer array: {counts}, dtype: {counts.dtype}")

# 2D array (matrix) - like an image
image_data = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
                       [40, 50, 60],
                       [70, 80, 90]])
print(f"2D array shape: {image_data.shape}")
print(f"2D array:\n{image_data}")
```

### Essential Array Creation Functions for Science

These functions are workhorses in scientific computing:

```{code-cell} python
# linspace: Evenly spaced values (inclusive endpoints)
# Perfect for wavelength grids, time series
wavelengths_nm = np.linspace(400, 700, 11)  # 11 points from 400 to 700 nm
print(f"Wavelengths (nm): {wavelengths_nm}")

# Convert to CGS (cm)
wavelengths_cm = wavelengths_nm * 1e-7
print(f"Wavelengths (cm): {wavelengths_cm}")

# logspace: Logarithmically spaced values
# Essential for frequency grids, stellar masses
masses_solar = np.logspace(-1, 2, 4)  # 0.1 to 100 solar masses
masses_g = masses_solar * 1.989e33  # Convert to grams
print(f"Stellar masses (g): {masses_g:.2e}")

# arange: Like Python's range but returns array
times_s = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)  # 0 to 9.9 in 0.1s steps
print(f"Time points: {len(times_s)} samples from {times_s[0]} to {times_s[-1]}")

# zeros and ones: Initialize arrays
dark_frame = np.zeros((100, 100))  # 100x100 CCD dark frame
flat_field = np.ones((100, 100))   # Flat field (perfect response)
print(f"Dark frame shape: {dark_frame.shape}, sum: {dark_frame.sum()}")
print(f"Flat field shape: {flat_field.shape}, sum: {flat_field.sum()}")
```

:::{admonition} 💡 Computational Thinking Box: Row-Major vs Column-Major
:class: tip

**PATTERN: Memory Layout Matters for Performance**

NumPy stores arrays in row-major order (C-style) by default, meaning elements in the same row are adjacent in memory. This affects performance dramatically:

```python
# Row-major (NumPy default) - fast row operations
image = np.zeros((1000, 1000))
# Accessing image[0, :] is fast (contiguous memory)
# Accessing image[:, 0] is slower (strided memory)

# For column operations, consider Fortran order
image_fortran = np.zeros((1000, 1000), order='F')
# Now image_fortran[:, 0] is fast
```

Why this matters:
- Processing images row-by-row? Use default (C-order)
- Processing spectra in columns? Consider Fortran order
- Matrix multiplication? NumPy optimizes automatically

Real impact: The wrong memory order can make your code 10x slower for large arrays!
:::

### Random Arrays for Simulations

Scientific computing often requires random data for Monte Carlo simulations, noise modeling, and testing:

```{code-cell} python
# Set seed for reproducibility (crucial for scientific code!)
np.random.seed(42)

# Gaussian (normal) distribution - thermal noise, measurement errors
thermal_noise = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)  # mean=0, std=1
print(f"Noise mean: {thermal_noise.mean():.3f}, std: {thermal_noise.std():.3f}")

# Poisson distribution - photon counting statistics
photon_counts = np.random.poisson(lam=100, size=1000)  # λ=100 photons
print(f"Photon counts mean: {photon_counts.mean():.1f}")
print(f"Expected std (√λ): {np.sqrt(100):.1f}, Actual: {photon_counts.std():.1f}")

# Uniform distribution - random positions
ra_random = np.random.uniform(0, 360, size=100)  # degrees
dec_random = np.random.uniform(-90, 90, size=100)  # degrees
print(f"Random sky positions: RA ∈ [{ra_random.min():.1f}, {ra_random.max():.1f}]°")
```

:::{admonition} 🔍 Check Your Understanding
:class: question

What's the difference between `np.linspace(0, 10, 11)` and `np.arange(0, 11, 1)`?

:::{dropdown} Answer
Both create arrays from 0 to 10, but:
- `np.linspace(0, 10, 11)` creates exactly 11 evenly-spaced points including both endpoints: [0, 1, 2, ..., 10]
- `np.arange(0, 11, 1)` creates points from 0 up to (but not including) 11 with step 1: [0, 1, 2, ..., 10]

In this case they're equivalent, but:
- `np.linspace(0, 10, 20)` gives 20 points with fractional spacing
- `np.arange(0, 10.5, 0.5)` gives points with exact 0.5 steps

Use `linspace` when you need a specific number of points, `arange` when you need a specific step size.

## 7.3 Array Operations: Vectorization Powers

{margin} **Vectorization**
Performing operations on entire arrays at once rather than using explicit loops.

The true power of NumPy lies in vectorized operations – performing calculations on entire arrays without writing loops:

```{code-cell} python
# Basic arithmetic operates element-wise
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])

print(f"a + b = {a + b}")      # Element-wise addition
print(f"a * b = {a * b}")      # Element-wise multiplication
print(f"a ** 2 = {a ** 2}")    # Element-wise power
print(f"b / a = {b / a}")      # Element-wise division

# Compare with list approach (verbose and slow)
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
result_list = []
for i in range(len(a_list)):
    result_list.append(a_list[i] + b_list[i])
print(f"List addition: {result_list}")  # Same result, more code!
```

### Universal Functions (ufuncs): Optimized Operations

NumPy's universal functions operate element-wise on arrays with optimized C code:

```{code-cell} python
# Trigonometric functions for coordinate transformations
angles_deg = np.array([0, 30, 45, 60, 90])
angles_rad = np.deg2rad(angles_deg)  # Convert to radians

sines = np.sin(angles_rad)
cosines = np.cos(angles_rad)

print(f"Angles (deg): {angles_deg}")
print(f"sin(θ): {sines}")
print(f"cos(θ): {cosines}")
print(f"sin²(θ) + cos²(θ): {sines**2 + cosines**2}")  # Should all be 1!

# Exponential and logarithm for magnitude scales
magnitudes = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 10])
flux_ratios = 10**(-magnitudes/2.5)  # Pogson's equation
print(f"\nMagnitudes: {magnitudes}")
print(f"Flux ratios: {flux_ratios}")

# Verify: magnitude difference = -2.5 * log10(flux ratio)
recovered_mags = -2.5 * np.log10(flux_ratios)
print(f"Recovered magnitudes: {recovered_mags}")
```

### Array Methods: Built-in Analysis

Arrays come with methods for common statistical operations:

```{code-cell} python
# Create sample data: Gaussian with outliers
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)  # Normal dist: mean=100, std=15
data[::100] = 200  # Add outliers every 100th point

# Statistical methods
print(f"Mean: {data.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Median: {np.median(data):.2f}")  # More robust to outliers
print(f"Std dev: {data.std():.2f}")
print(f"Min: {data.min():.2f}, Max: {data.max():.2f}")

# Find outliers
outliers = data > 150
n_outliers = outliers.sum()  # True counts as 1
print(f"Number of outliers (>150): {n_outliers}")

# Clean data by filtering
clean_data = data[~outliers]  # ~ means NOT
print(f"Clean mean: {clean_data.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Clean std: {clean_data.std():.2f}")
```

:::{admonition} ⚠️ Common Bug Alert: Integer Division Trap
:class: warning

```{code-cell} python
# DANGER: Integer arrays can cause unexpected results!
counts = np.array([100, 200, 300])  # Default type is int
normalized = counts / counts.max()
print(f"Normalized (float result): {normalized}")

# But watch out for integer division in older NumPy or with //
integer_div = counts // 2  # Floor division
print(f"Integer division by 2: {integer_div}")

# Mixed operations preserve precision
counts_int = np.array([100, 200, 300], dtype=int)
scale = 2.5  # float
scaled = counts_int / scale  # Result is float!
print(f"Int array / float = {scaled}")

# Best practice: Use float arrays for scientific calculations
counts_safe = np.array([100, 200, 300], dtype=float)
print(f"Safe float array: {counts_safe / counts_safe.max()}")
```

Always use float arrays for scientific calculations unless you specifically need integer arithmetic!
:::

## 7.4 Indexing and Slicing: Data Selection Mastery

{margin} **Boolean Masking**
Using boolean arrays to select elements that meet certain conditions.

NumPy's indexing extends Python's list indexing with powerful new capabilities:

```{code-cell} python
# 1D indexing (like lists but more powerful)
spectrum = np.array([1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.1, 0.9, 0.8])
print(f"Full spectrum: {spectrum}")
print(f"First element: {spectrum[0]}")
print(f"Last element: {spectrum[-1]}")
print(f"Middle section: {spectrum[2:5]}")

# Fancy indexing - select multiple specific indices
important_indices = [0, 2, 4, 6]
selected = spectrum[important_indices]
print(f"Selected wavelengths: {selected}")

# 2D indexing - like accessing matrix elements
image = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
                  [40, 50, 60],
                  [70, 80, 90]])
print(f"\n2D array:\n{image}")
print(f"Element at row 1, col 2: {image[1, 2]}")  # Note: comma notation!
print(f"Entire row 1: {image[1, :]}")
print(f"Entire column 2: {image[:, 2]}")
print(f"Sub-image: \n{image[0:2, 1:3]}")
```

### Boolean Masking: The Power Tool

Boolean masking is one of NumPy's most powerful features for data filtering:

```{code-cell} python
# Stellar catalog example
stars_mag = np.array([8.2, 12.5, 6.1, 15.3, 9.7, 11.2, 5.5])
stars_color = np.array([0.5, 1.2, 0.3, 1.8, 0.7, 1.0, 0.2])  # B-V color

# Create boolean masks
bright_mask = stars_mag < 10  # True where magnitude < 10
blue_mask = stars_color < 0.6  # True where B-V < 0.6 (blue stars)

print(f"Bright stars mask: {bright_mask}")
print(f"Bright star magnitudes: {stars_mag[bright_mask]}")

# Combine conditions
bright_and_blue = (stars_mag < 10) & (stars_color < 0.6)  # Note: & not 'and'
print(f"Bright AND blue: {stars_mag[bright_and_blue]}")

# Count matching objects
n_bright = bright_mask.sum()  # True = 1, False = 0
print(f"Number of bright stars: {n_bright}")
```

### The where Function: Conditional Operations

The `np.where()` function is incredibly versatile for conditional operations:

```{code-cell} python
# Find indices where condition is true
data = np.array([1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 9, 4])
high_indices = np.where(data > 5)[0]  # Returns tuple, we want first element
print(f"Indices where data > 5: {high_indices}")
print(f"Values at those indices: {data[high_indices]}")

# Conditional replacement
# where(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
clipped = np.where(data > 5, 5, data)  # Clip values above 5
print(f"Clipped data: {clipped}")

# More complex: different operations based on condition
# Flux calibration: apply different corrections to different ranges
raw_flux = np.array([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])
wavelength = np.array([400, 450, 500, 550, 600])  # nm

# Different sensitivity corrections for blue vs red
corrected = np.where(wavelength < 500,
                     raw_flux * 1.2,  # Blue correction
                     raw_flux * 0.9)  # Red correction
print(f"Raw flux: {raw_flux}")
print(f"Corrected flux: {corrected}")
```

:::{admonition} 🌟 Why This Matters: Finding Exoplanets with Boolean Masking
:class: info, important

The Kepler Space Telescope discovered over 2,600 exoplanets by monitoring the brightness of 150,000 stars continuously for four years. Finding planets in this data required sophisticated boolean masking with NumPy.

When a planet transits its star, the brightness drops by typically 0.01% - 1%. But the data is noisy, with stellar flares, cosmic rays, and instrumental effects. Here's a simplified version of the detection algorithm:

```python
# Simulated light curve data
time = np.linspace(0, 30, 1000)  # 30 days
flux = np.ones_like(time) + np.random.normal(0, 0.001, 1000)  # Noise

# Add transits every 3.5 days (period), 0.1 day duration, 1% deep
period, duration, depth = 3.5, 0.1, 0.01
in_transit = ((time % period) < duration)
flux[in_transit] -= depth

# Detection using boolean masking
median_flux = np.median(flux)
threshold = median_flux - 3 * flux.std()  # 3-sigma detection
transit_candidates = flux < threshold
n_transits = np.diff(np.where(transit_candidates)[0] > 1).sum()

print(f"Found {n_transits} transit events")
```

This technique, scaled up with more sophisticated statistics, is how we've discovered thousands of worlds orbiting other stars!

## 7.5 Broadcasting: NumPy's Secret Superpower

{margin} **Broadcasting**
NumPy's ability to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding dimensions.

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes, eliminating the need for explicit loops or array duplication:

```{code-cell} python
# Simple broadcasting: scalar with array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
result = arr + 10  # 10 is "broadcast" to [10, 10, 10, 10]
print(f"Array + scalar: {result}")

# Row vector + column vector = matrix
row = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])      # Shape (1, 3)
col = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])  # Shape (3, 1)
matrix = row + col  # Broadcasting creates (3, 3) result
print(f"Row shape: {row.shape}")
print(f"Column shape: {col.shape}")
print(f"Result:\n{matrix}")
print(f"Result shape: {matrix.shape}")
```

### Broadcasting Rules

Broadcasting follows simple rules:
1. Arrays are compatible if dimensions are equal or one is 1
2. Missing dimensions are treated as 1
3. Arrays are stretched along dimensions of size 1

```{code-cell} python
# Practical example: Normalize each row of a matrix
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6],
                 [7, 8, 9]], dtype=float)

# Calculate row means (shape: 3,)
row_means = data.mean(axis=1)  # axis=1 means along columns
print(f"Row means: {row_means}")

# To subtract row means from each row, we need to reshape
row_means_reshaped = row_means.reshape(-1, 1)  # Shape: (3, 1)
normalized = data - row_means_reshaped  # Broadcasting!
print(f"Normalized data:\n{normalized}")
print(f"New row means: {normalized.mean(axis=1)}")  # Should be ~0
```

### Real-World Broadcasting: Image Processing

```{code-cell} python
# Flat-field correction for CCD images
np.random.seed(42)

# Simulate CCD data
raw_image = np.random.poisson(1000, size=(100, 100))  # 100x100 pixels
dark_current = np.full((100, 100), 50)  # Uniform dark current
flat_field = np.ones((100, 100))
flat_field[:, :50] = 0.9  # Left half less sensitive

# Calibrate image using broadcasting
calibrated = (raw_image - dark_current) / flat_field

print(f"Raw image mean: {raw_image.mean():.1f}")
print(f"Calibrated mean: {calibrated.mean():.1f}")
print(f"Left half sensitivity: {calibrated[:, :50].mean():.1f}")
print(f"Right half sensitivity: {calibrated[:, 50:].mean():.1f}")
```

:::{admonition} ⚠️ Common Bug Alert: Broadcasting Shape Mismatch
:class: warning

```{code-cell} python
# Common mistake: incompatible shapes
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Shape: (3,)

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Solutions:
# 1. Pad the shorter array
b_padded = np.append(b, 0)  # Now shape (3,)

Always check shapes when debugging broadcasting errors!

## 7.6 Array Manipulation: Reshaping Your Data

{margin} **View**
A new array object that shares data with the original array.

{margin} **Copy**
A new array with its own data, independent of the original.

NumPy provides powerful tools for reorganizing array data:

```{code-cell} python
# Reshape: Change dimensions without changing data
data = np.arange(12)
print(f"Original: {data}")

# Reshape to 2D
matrix = data.reshape(3, 4)
print(f"As 3x4 matrix:\n{matrix}")

# Reshape to 3D
cube = data.reshape(2, 2, 3)
print(f"As 2x2x3 cube:\n{cube}")

# Use -1 to infer dimension
auto_reshape = data.reshape(3, -1)  # NumPy figures out the 4
print(f"Auto-reshape to 3x?:\n{auto_reshape}")

# Flatten back to 1D
flattened = matrix.flatten()
print(f"Flattened: {flattened}")
```

### Stacking and Splitting Arrays

Combining and separating arrays is common in data analysis:

```{code-cell} python
# Stacking arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.array([7, 8, 9])

# Vertical stack (row-wise)
vstacked = np.vstack([a, b, c])
print(f"Vertical stack:\n{vstacked}")

# Horizontal stack (column-wise)
hstacked = np.hstack([a, b, c])
print(f"Horizontal stack: {hstacked}")

# Stack as columns
column_stack = np.column_stack([a, b, c])
print(f"Column stack:\n{column_stack}")

# Split arrays
big_array = np.arange(12)
chunks = np.split(big_array, 3)  # Split into 3 equal parts
print(f"Split into chunks: {[chunk.tolist() for chunk in chunks]}")
```

### Transpose and Axis Manipulation

```{code-cell} python
# Transpose swaps axes
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])
transposed = matrix.T
print(f"Original shape: {matrix.shape}")
print(f"Original:\n{matrix}")
print(f"Transposed shape: {transposed.shape}")
print(f"Transposed:\n{transposed}")

# For higher dimensions, specify axis order
cube = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
print(f"Original cube shape: {cube.shape}")

# Swap first and last axes
swapped = np.transpose(cube, (2, 1, 0))
print(f"Swapped axes shape: {swapped.shape}")
```

:::{admonition} 💡 Computational Thinking Box: Views vs Copies
:class: tip

**PATTERN: Memory Efficiency Through Views**

Many NumPy operations return views, not copies, sharing memory with the original:

```python
original = np.arange(10)
view = original[2:8]  # This is a view
view[0] = 999  # Modifies original!
print(original)  # [0, 1, 999, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# To ensure independence, explicitly copy
safe_copy = original[2:8].copy()
safe_copy[0] = 111  # Doesn't affect original
```

Operations that typically return views:
- Slicing: `arr[2:8]`
- Reshaping: `arr.reshape(2, 5)`
- Transpose: `arr.T`

Operations that return copies:
- Fancy indexing: `arr[[1, 3, 5]]`
- Boolean indexing: `arr[arr > 5]`
- Arithmetic: `arr + 1`

Why it matters: Views save memory (crucial for large datasets) but can cause unexpected data modification. When in doubt, use `.copy()`!

## 7.7 Essential Scientific Functions

NumPy provides specialized functions crucial for scientific computing:

### Meshgrid: Creating Coordinate Grids

```{code-cell} python
# Create 2D coordinate grids for evaluation
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 5)
y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 3)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

print(f"x coordinates:\n{X}")
print(f"y coordinates:\n{Y}")

# Evaluate function on grid
Z = X**2 + Y**2  # Paraboloid
print(f"Function values:\n{Z}")

# Common use: creating synthetic images
x_pixels = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y_pixels = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
X_img, Y_img = np.meshgrid(x_pixels, y_pixels)

# Create 2D Gaussian (like a star PSF)
sigma = 2.0
star_psf = np.exp(-((X_img - 5)**2 + (Y_img - 5)**2) / (2 * sigma**2))
print(f"PSF shape: {star_psf.shape}, peak: {star_psf.max():.3f}")
```

### Interpolation with interp

```{code-cell} python
# Linear interpolation - crucial for spectra, light curves
wavelengths_measured = np.array([400, 500, 600, 700])  # nm
flux_measured = np.array([1.0, 1.5, 1.2, 0.8])

# Interpolate to finer grid
wavelengths_fine = np.linspace(400, 700, 31)
flux_interpolated = np.interp(wavelengths_fine, wavelengths_measured, flux_measured)

print(f"Original: {len(wavelengths_measured)} points")
print(f"Interpolated: {len(wavelengths_fine)} points")
print(f"Flux at 550 nm: {np.interp(550, wavelengths_measured, flux_measured):.3f}")
```

### Fourier Transforms: Frequency Analysis

```{code-cell} python
# Create a signal with multiple frequencies
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 500)  # 1 second, 500 samples
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * t)  # 5 Hz
signal += 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 10 * t)  # 10 Hz
signal += 0.2 * np.random.normal(size=t.shape)  # Noise

# Compute FFT
fft = np.fft.fft(signal)
freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(len(t), t[1] - t[0])

# Power spectrum
power = np.abs(fft)**2

# Find positive frequencies only
pos_mask = freqs > 0
freqs_pos = freqs[pos_mask]
power_pos = power[pos_mask]

# Find peaks
peak_freqs = freqs_pos[power_pos > power_pos.max() / 10]
print(f"Detected frequencies: {peak_freqs[:5]} Hz")
```

## 7.8 Performance and Memory Considerations

Understanding NumPy's performance characteristics helps write efficient code:

```{code-cell} python
# Compare performance: loops vs vectorization
size = 100000
a = np.random.randn(size)
b = np.random.randn(size)

# Method 1: Python loop
start = time.perf_counter()
result_loop = []
for i in range(size):
    result_loop.append(a[i] * b[i] + a[i]**2)
loop_time = time.perf_counter() - start

# Method 2: NumPy vectorization
start = time.perf_counter()
result_vector = a * b + a**2
vector_time = time.perf_counter() - start

print(f"Loop time: {loop_time*1000:.2f} ms")
print(f"Vector time: {vector_time*1000:.2f} ms")
print(f"Speedup: {loop_time/vector_time:.1f}x")

# Memory usage
array_float64 = np.ones(1000000, dtype=np.float64)
array_float32 = np.ones(1000000, dtype=np.float32)
print(f"\nMemory usage:")
print(f"float64: {array_float64.nbytes / 1e6:.1f} MB")
print(f"float32: {array_float32.nbytes / 1e6:.1f} MB")
```

:::{admonition} 🔍 Check Your Understanding
:class: question

Why is `np.empty()` faster than `np.zeros()` but potentially dangerous?

:::{dropdown} Answer
`np.empty()` allocates memory without initializing values, while `np.zeros()` allocates and sets all values to 0.

```python
# empty is faster but contains garbage
empty_arr = np.empty(5)
print(empty_arr)  # Random values from memory!

# zeros is slower but safe
zero_arr = np.zeros(5)
print(zero_arr)  # Guaranteed [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```

Use `np.empty()` only when you'll immediately overwrite all values. Otherwise, you might accidentally use uninitialized data, leading to non-reproducible bugs!

## Main Takeaways

You've just acquired the fundamental tool that transforms Python into a scientific computing powerhouse. NumPy isn't just a faster way to work with numbers – it's a different way of thinking about computation. Instead of writing loops that process elements one at a time, you now express mathematical operations on entire datasets at once. This vectorized thinking mirrors how we conceptualize scientific problems: we don't think about individual photons hitting individual pixels; we think about images, spectra, and light curves as coherent wholes. NumPy lets you write code that matches this conceptual model, making your programs both faster and more readable.

The performance gains you've witnessed – often 10-100x speedups – aren't just convenient; they're transformative. Calculations that would take hours with Python lists complete in seconds with NumPy arrays. This speed isn't achieved through complex optimization tricks but through NumPy's elegant design: contiguous memory storage, vectorized operations that call optimized C libraries, and broadcasting that eliminates redundant data copying. When you used NumPy to process gravitational wave data or search for exoplanet transits, you experienced the same performance that enables real-time astronomical data analysis at observatories worldwide.

Beyond performance, NumPy provides a vocabulary for scientific computing that's consistent across the entire Python ecosystem. The array indexing, broadcasting rules, and ufuncs you've learned aren't just NumPy features – they're the standard interface for numerical computation in Python. When you move on to using SciPy for optimization, Matplotlib for visualization, or Pandas for data analysis, you'll find they all speak NumPy's language. This consistency means the effort you've invested in understanding NumPy pays dividends across every scientific Python library you'll ever use.

Looking ahead, NumPy arrays will be the primary data structure for the rest of your scientific computing journey. Every image you process, every spectrum you analyze, every simulation you run will flow through NumPy arrays. You now have the tools to replace the math module entirely, using NumPy's functions that work seamlessly on both scalars and arrays. The concepts you've mastered – vectorization, broadcasting, boolean masking – aren't just programming techniques; they're computational thinking patterns that will shape how you approach every numerical problem. You're no longer limited by Python's native capabilities; you have access to the same computational power that enabled the detection of gravitational waves, the discovery of exoplanets, and the imaging of black holes.

## Definitions

**Array**: NumPy's fundamental data structure, a grid of values all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of integers.

**Broadcasting**: NumPy's mechanism for performing operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding dimensions according to specific rules.

**Boolean Masking**: Using an array of boolean values to select elements from another array that meet certain conditions.

**Copy**: A new array with its own data, independent of the original array's memory.

**dtype**: The data type of array elements, determining memory usage and numerical precision (e.g., float64, int32).

**ndarray**: NumPy's n-dimensional array object, the core data structure for numerical computation.

**NumPy**: Numerical Python, the fundamental package for scientific computing providing support for arrays and mathematical functions.

**Shape**: The dimensions of an array, given as a tuple indicating the size along each axis.

**ufunc**: Universal function, a NumPy function that operates element-wise on arrays, supporting broadcasting and type casting.

**Vectorization**: Performing operations on entire arrays at once rather than using explicit loops, leveraging optimized C code.

**View**: A new array object that shares data with the original array, saving memory but linking modifications.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **NumPy arrays are 10-100x faster than Python lists** for numerical operations by using contiguous memory and calling optimized C libraries

✓ **Vectorization eliminates explicit loops** by operating on entire arrays at once, making code both faster and more readable

✓ **NumPy can replace the math module entirely** while adding array support – use `np.sin()` instead of `math.sin()` everywhere

✓ **Broadcasting enables operations on different-shaped arrays** by automatically expanding dimensions, eliminating data duplication

✓ **Boolean masking provides powerful data filtering** using conditions to select array elements, essential for data analysis

✓ **Essential creation functions** like `linspace`, `logspace`, and `where` are workhorses for scientific computing

✓ **Memory layout matters** – row-major vs column-major ordering can cause 10x performance differences

✓ **Views share memory while copies are independent** – understanding this prevents unexpected data modifications

✓ **Array methods provide built-in analysis** – `.mean()`, `.std()`, `.max()` operate efficiently along specified axes

✓ **NumPy is the foundation of scientific Python** – every major package (SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas) builds on NumPy arrays

## Next Chapter Preview

In Chapter 8: Matplotlib, you'll discover how to transform the NumPy arrays you've mastered into publication-quality visualizations. You'll learn to create everything from simple line plots to complex multi-panel figures displaying astronomical data. Using the same NumPy arrays you've been working with, you'll visualize spectra, create color-magnitude diagrams, display telescope images with proper coordinate systems, and generate the kinds of plots that appear in research papers. The NumPy operations you've learned – slicing, masking, and transforming data – become the foundation for creating compelling scientific visualizations. Most importantly, you'll understand how NumPy and Matplotlib work together as an integrated system, with NumPy handling the computation and Matplotlib handling the visualization, forming the core workflow of scientific Python!
