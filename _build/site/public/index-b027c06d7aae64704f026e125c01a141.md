# Final Project: Neural Networks & JAX

The culminating project for ASTR 596 where you implement neural networks from scratch and then translate to the JAX ecosystem.

## Project Overview

This capstone project synthesizes everything you've learned throughout the course:

- **Neural Network Implementation**: Build backpropagation from first principles
- **JAX Translation**: Convert your NumPy implementation to JAX
- **Astrophysical Application**: Apply your networks to real astronomical data
- **Research-Quality Output**: Publication-ready analysis and documentation

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Understand neural network fundamentals** at the mathematical level
2. **Implement automatic differentiation** manually before using JAX
3. **Master the JAX ecosystem** for high-performance computing
4. **Apply ML to astrophysics** with proper scientific methodology
5. **Produce research-quality work** suitable for academic or industry contexts

## Project Components

### Phase 1: From Scratch Implementation (Weeks 13-14)

- Manual backpropagation in pure NumPy
- Custom automatic differentiation
- Training on astronomical datasets

### Phase 2: JAX Translation (Week 15)
