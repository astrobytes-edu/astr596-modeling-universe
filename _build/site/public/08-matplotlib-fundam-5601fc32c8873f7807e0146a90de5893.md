### Self-Assessment Diagnostic

Test your readiness by predicting the outputs and identifying any issues:

```{code-cell} python
import numpy as np

# Question 1: What shape will this array have?
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
# Shape of y: _______

# Question 2: What will this boolean mask select?
data = np.array([1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 9])
mask = data > 5
selected = data[mask]
# selected contains: _______

# Question 3: What's wrong with this code?
# matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
# result = matrix + [10, 20, 30]  # Will this work?
# Your answer: _______

# Question 4: What will this create?
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(5), np.arange(3))
# Shape of X and Y: _______
```

:::{dropdown} Self-Assessment Answers
1. Shape of y: `(100,)` - 1D array with 100 elements
2. selected contains: `[8, 9]` - values greater than 5
3. Broadcasting error - shapes (2,2) and (3,) are incompatible
4. Shape of X and Y: Both are `(3, 5)` - 2D grids

If you got all four correct, you're ready for Matplotlib! If not, review Chapter 7.

## Chapter Overview

Data without visualization is like a telescope without an eyepiece — you might have collected photons from distant galaxies, but you can't see the universe they reveal. Every major astronomical discovery of the past century has been communicated through carefully crafted visualizations: Hubble's plot showing the expanding universe (Hubble 1929), Hertzsprung and Russell's diagram revealing stellar evolution, the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background proving inflation theory. These weren't just pretty pictures; they were visual arguments that changed our understanding of the cosmos. **Matplotlib** (Hunter 2007), the foundational plotting library for scientific Python, gives you the power to create these kinds of transformative visualizations, turning your NumPy arrays into insights that can be shared, published, and understood.

But here's what many tutorials won't tell you: Matplotlib isn't just a plotting library — it's an artist's studio. Like an artist selecting brushes, canvases, and colors, you'll learn to choose plot types, figure sizes, and colormaps that best express your data's story. Creating a great visualization isn't about following rigid rules; it's about **experimentation**, iteration, and developing an aesthetic sense for what works. You'll discover that the difference between a confusing plot and a revealing one often comes down to trying different scales — linear versus logarithmic, different color mappings, or simply adjusting the aspect ratio. This chapter embraces that experimental nature, teaching you not just the mechanics of plotting but the art of visual exploration. You'll learn to approach each dataset as a unique challenge, trying multiple visualizations until you find the one that makes the patterns jump off the page.

This chapter introduces Matplotlib's two main interfaces — **pyplot** for quick exploration and the **object-oriented API** for full control — but focuses on the latter because it's what you'll use for research. You'll master the anatomy of a **figure**, understanding how figures contain **axes**, how axes contain plots, and how every element can be customized. You'll learn the astronomical visualization canon: **light curves** that reveal exoplanets, **spectra** that encode stellar chemistry, **color-magnitude diagrams** that map stellar populations, and images that capture the structure of galaxies. Most crucially, you'll develop visualization taste — the ability to choose the right plot type, scale, and layout to honestly and effectively communicate your scientific findings. By the chapter's end, you won't just make plots; you'll craft visual narratives that can stand alongside those historic diagrams that revolutionized astronomy. And you'll have built your own library of plotting functions, turning common visualizations into single function calls that encode your hard-won knowledge about what works.

:::{admonition} 📚 Essential Resource: Matplotlib Documentation

## 8.1 Matplotlib as Your Artistic Medium

:::

Before we dive into technical details, let's establish a fundamental principle: creating visualizations is an inherently creative act. You're not just displaying data; you're making countless aesthetic choices that affect how your message is received. Consider these two philosophies:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some data - a damped oscillation
time = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
signal = np.exp(-time/3) * np.sin(2 * np.pi * time)

# Approach 1: The Default Plot (technically correct but uninspiring)
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

ax1.plot(time, signal)
ax1.set_title('Default: Technically Correct')

# Approach 2: The Artistic Plot (same data, different choices)
ax2.plot(time, signal, color='#2E86AB', linewidth=2, alpha=0.8)
ax2.fill_between(time, signal, alpha=0.2, color='#2E86AB')
ax2.axhline(y=0, color='#A23B72', linestyle='-', linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.5)
ax2.set_xlabel('Time (s)', fontsize=11, fontweight='light')
ax2.set_ylabel('Amplitude', fontsize=11, fontweight='light')
ax2.set_title('Artistic: Same Data, Better Story', fontsize=13, fontweight='bold')
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.15, linestyle='-', linewidth=0.5)
ax2.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax2.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Both plots show the same data, but the second one makes deliberate choices about color, transparency, and styling that make it more engaging. This is what we mean by being an artist with Matplotlib — every element is under your control, and those choices matter.

### The Experimentation Mindset

Creating effective visualizations requires **experimentation**. You rarely get it right on the first try. Here's a realistic workflow:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Real data: stellar magnitudes with a power-law distribution
np.random.seed(42)
masses = np.random.pareto(2.35, 1000) + 0.1  # Stellar IMF (Salpeter 1955)
luminosities = masses ** 3.5  # Mass-luminosity relation
luminosities += np.random.normal(0, 0.1 * luminosities)  # Add scatter

# Try different visualizations to find what reveals the pattern best
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(12, 8))

# Attempt 1: Simple scatter
axes[0, 0].scatter(masses, luminosities, s=1, alpha=0.5)
axes[0, 0].set_title('Linear Scale: Pattern Hidden')
axes[0, 0].set_xlabel('Mass [$M_☉$]')
axes[0, 0].set_ylabel('Luminosity [$L_☉$]')

# Attempt 2: Log-log reveals power law!
axes[0, 1].loglog(masses, luminosities, '.', markersize=2, alpha=0.5)
axes[0, 1].set_title('Log-Log: Power Law Revealed!')
axes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Mass [M_☉]')
axes[0, 1].set_ylabel('Luminosity [L_☉]')

# Attempt 3: Semilog-x (wrong choice for this data)
axes[0, 2].semilogx(masses, luminosities, '.', markersize=2, alpha=0.5)
axes[0, 2].set_title('Semilog-X: Not Helpful Here')
axes[0, 2].set_xlabel('Mass [M_☉]')
axes[0, 2].set_ylabel('Luminosity [L_☉]')

# Attempt 4: 2D histogram for density
h = axes[1, 0].hist2d(np.log10(masses), np.log10(luminosities), 
                       bins=30, cmap='YlOrRd')
axes[1, 0].set_title('2D Histogram: Shows Density')
axes[1, 0].set_xlabel('log(Mass)')
axes[1, 0].set_ylabel('log(Luminosity)')

# Attempt 5: Hexbin for large datasets
axes[1, 1].hexbin(masses, luminosities, gridsize=20, 
                  xscale='log', yscale='log', cmap='Blues')
axes[1, 1].set_title('Hexbin: Good for Large N')
axes[1, 1].set_xlabel('Mass (M☉)')
axes[1, 1].set_ylabel('Luminosity (L☉)')

# Attempt 6: Contours with scatter overlay
from scipy.stats import gaussian_kde
xy = np.vstack([np.log10(masses), np.log10(luminosities)])
z = gaussian_kde(xy)(xy)
idx = z.argsort()
x, y, z = np.log10(masses)[idx], np.log10(luminosities)[idx], z[idx]
axes[1, 2].scatter(x, y, c=z, s=1, cmap='viridis')
axes[1, 2].set_title('KDE-Colored: Shows Structure')
axes[1, 2].set_xlabel('log(Mass)')
axes[1, 2].set_ylabel('log(Luminosity)')

plt.suptitle('Experimentation Reveals the Best Visualization', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Key Lesson: The log-log plot immediately reveals the power-law relationship")
print("that was completely hidden in the linear plot. Always experiment!")
```

:::{admonition} 🎯 The More You Know: How a Plot Saved Dark Energy
:class: note, story

In 1998, two teams were racing to measure the universe's deceleration by observing Type Ia supernovae — "standard candles" whose known brightness reveals their distance. The Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter, and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, led by Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess, expected to find the expansion slowing down due to gravity.

The critical moment came not from sophisticated analysis but from visualization choices. The teams tried dozens of ways to plot their data: magnitude versus redshift, distance versus redshift, logarithmic scales, linear scales. Nothing showed a clear pattern. Then Adam Riess had an idea: instead of plotting raw magnitudes, plot the *residuals* — the difference between observed and expected magnitudes for a matter-only universe (Riess et al. 1998).

```python
# Simplified version of the Nobel Prize-winning plot
z = np.array([0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])  # Redshift
# Expected magnitudes for matter-only universe
m_expected = 5 * np.log10(z * 3000) + 25  # Simplified
# Observed magnitudes (dimmer than expected!)
m_observed = m_expected + 0.25 * z  # Supernovae are dimmer!

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Original plot - pattern not obvious
ax1.plot(z, m_observed, 'ro', markersize=8)
ax1.plot(z, m_expected, 'b--', label='Expected (matter only)')
ax1.set_xlabel('Redshift (z)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Magnitude')
ax1.set_title('Original Plot: Hard to See')
ax1.legend()

# Residual plot - acceleration jumps out!
ax2.plot(z, m_observed - m_expected, 'ro', markersize=8)
ax2.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='--', label='No acceleration')
ax2.set_xlabel('Redshift (z)')
ax2.set_ylabel('Δm (observed - expected)')
ax2.set_title('Residual Plot: Universe Accelerating!')
ax2.legend()
```

The residual plot made it obvious: supernovae were consistently dimmer than expected. The universe wasn't just expanding; it was accelerating! This visualization choice — the result of experimentation and artistic judgment — led to a Nobel Prize (Perlmutter et al. 1999). Sometimes the difference between confusion and clarity is how you choose to plot your data.

## 8.2 Anatomy of a Figure

Understanding Matplotlib's hierarchy is crucial for controlling your visualizations. Nicolas P. Rougier created the definitive visualization of this anatomy (Rougier 2018), which has become the standard reference:

Y1 = 3 + np.cos(X)
Y2 = 1 + np.cos(1 + X/0.75)/2
Y3 = np.random.uniform(Y1, Y2, len(X))

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8), facecolor="w")
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, aspect=1)

# Configure the tick system

# Add the plot elements
ax.grid(linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5, color='.25', zorder=-10)
ax.plot(X, Y1, c=(0.25, 0.25, 1.00), lw=2, label="Blue signal", zorder=10)
ax.plot(X, Y2, c=(1.00, 0.25, 0.25), lw=2, label="Red signal")

```

This brilliant visualization by Rougier (2018) shows how every element — from the figure container down to individual tick labels — forms part of Matplotlib's hierarchical structure. Understanding these relationships is what gives you the power to customize every aspect of your plots.

### Working with the Object-Oriented Interface

:::{margin} **Backend**
The rendering engine Matplotlib uses to create and display figures.
:::

Now that you understand the anatomy, let's see how to manipulate these elements:

```{code-cell} python
# Create a figure with explicit control over components
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Add axes manually to see the structure
# [left, bottom, width, height] in figure coordinates (0-1)
ax_main = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.6])   # Main plot
ax_zoom = fig.add_axes([0.65, 0.6, 0.2, 0.2])  # Inset zoom
ax_residual = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.05, 0.7, 0.2])  # Residual panel

# Generate data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x) * np.exp(-x/10)
y_model = np.sin(x) * np.exp(-x/10.5)  # Slightly different model

# Main plot
ax_main.plot(x, y, 'ko', markersize=3, alpha=0.5, label='Data')
ax_main.plot(x, y_model, 'r-', linewidth=2, label='Model')
ax_main.set_ylabel('Signal', fontsize=12)
ax_main.legend(loc='upper right')
ax_main.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Zoom inset
zoom_mask = (x > 3) & (x < 5)
ax_zoom.plot(x[zoom_mask], y[zoom_mask], 'ko', markersize=2)
ax_zoom.plot(x[zoom_mask], y_model[zoom_mask], 'r-', linewidth=1)
ax_zoom.set_xlim(3, 5)
ax_zoom.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax_zoom.set_title('Zoom', fontsize=9)

# Residuals
residuals = y - y_model
ax_residual.scatter(x, residuals, s=5, alpha=0.5, color='blue')
ax_residual.axhline(y=0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=1)
ax_residual.set_xlabel('Time', fontsize=12)
ax_residual.set_ylabel('Residuals', fontsize=10)
ax_residual.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

fig.suptitle('Explicit Control Over Figure Components', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.show()
```

:::{admonition} 💡 Computational Thinking Box: Figure Memory Management
:class: tip

**PATTERN: Managing Memory with Many Plots**

When creating many figures in a loop (common when processing astronomical surveys), memory usage can explode if not managed properly:

```python
# BAD: Memory leak - figures accumulate!
for i in range(100):
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(data[i])
    plt.savefig(f'plot_{i}.png')
    # Figure stays in memory!

# GOOD: Explicitly close figures
for i in range(100):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(data[i])
    fig.savefig(f'plot_{i}.png')
    plt.close(fig)  # Free memory!

# BETTER: Use context manager
for i in range(100):
    with plt.subplots() as (fig, ax):
        ax.plot(data[i])
        fig.savefig(f'plot_{i}.png')
    # Automatically closed!
```

For large surveys processing thousands of objects, this difference between memory leak and proper management can mean the difference between success and crashing!

## 8.3 Choosing the Right Scale: Linear, Log, and Everything Between

:::{margin} **Linear Scale**
Equal steps in data correspond to equal distances on the plot.
:::

:::{margin} **Logarithmic Scale**
Equal multiplicative factors correspond to equal distances on the plot.
:::

:::{margin} **Power Law**
A relationship where $y \propto x^n$ appears as a straight line on a log-log plot.
:::

One of the most important skills in data visualization is choosing the right scale for your axes. The wrong scale can hide patterns; the right scale makes them obvious:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Generate different types of relationships
x = np.logspace(-1, 3, 100)  # 0.1 to 1000

# Different mathematical relationships
linear = 2 * x + 5
quadratic = 0.5 * x**2
exponential = np.exp(x/100)
power_law = 10 * x**(-1.5)
logarithmic = 50 * np.log10(x) + 10

# Create a comprehensive comparison
fig, axes = plt.subplots(5, 4, figsize=(14, 16))

datasets = [
    (linear, 'Linear: y = 2x + 5'),
    (quadratic, 'Quadratic: y = 0.5x²'),
    (exponential, 'Exponential: y = e^(x/100)'),
    (power_law, 'Power Law: y = 10x^(-1.5)'),
    (logarithmic, 'Logarithmic: y = 50log(x) + 10')
]

for i, (data, title) in enumerate(datasets):
    # Linear-linear
    axes[i, 0].plot(x, data, 'b-', linewidth=2)
    axes[i, 0].set_title(f'{title}\nLinear-Linear')
    axes[i, 0].grid(True, alpha=0.3)
    
    # Log-log
    axes[i, 1].loglog(x, np.abs(data), 'r-', linewidth=2)
    axes[i, 1].set_title('Log-Log')
    axes[i, 1].grid(True, alpha=0.3, which='both')
    
    # Semilog-x
    axes[i, 2].semilogx(x, data, 'g-', linewidth=2)
    axes[i, 2].set_title('Semilog-X')
    axes[i, 2].grid(True, alpha=0.3)
    
    # Semilog-y
    axes[i, 3].semilogy(x, np.abs(data), 'm-', linewidth=2)
    axes[i, 3].set_title('Semilog-Y')
    axes[i, 3].grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Highlight which scale reveals linearity
axes[0, 0].set_facecolor('#E8F4F8')  # Linear shows linear
axes[2, 3].set_facecolor('#F8E8E8')  # Semilogy shows exponential
axes[3, 1].set_facecolor('#F8F8E8')  # Loglog shows power law
axes[4, 2].set_facecolor('#E8F8E8')  # Semilogx shows logarithmic

fig.suptitle('Choose the Scale that Reveals Your Data\'s Nature', 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Key insight: The 'right' scale makes relationships linear!")
print("- Power laws → log-log")
print("- Exponential growth → semilog-y")
print("- Logarithmic growth → semilog-x")
```

### Practical Guidelines for Scale Selection

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Real astronomical example: Galaxy luminosity function
np.random.seed(42)

# Schechter function parameters (Schechter 1976)
L_star = 1e10  # Characteristic luminosity
alpha = -1.25  # Faint-end slope
phi_star = 0.01  # Normalization

# Generate galaxy luminosities
L = np.logspace(7, 12, 1000)
phi = phi_star * (L/L_star)**alpha * np.exp(-L/L_star)

# Add observational scatter
observed_phi = phi * np.random.lognormal(0, 0.2, len(phi))

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 10))

# Linear scale - useless for this data
axes[0, 0].plot(L, observed_phi, '.', markersize=1, alpha=0.5)
axes[0, 0].set_xlabel('Luminosity (L☉)')
axes[0, 0].set_ylabel('Φ (Number density)')
axes[0, 0].set_title('Linear Scale: Cannot See Structure')

# Log-log - reveals power law at faint end
axes[0, 1].loglog(L, observed_phi, '.', markersize=1, alpha=0.5, label='Data')
axes[0, 1].loglog(L, phi, 'r-', linewidth=2, label='Schechter Function')
axes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Luminosity (L☉)')
axes[0, 1].set_ylabel('Φ (Number density)')
axes[0, 1].set_title('Log-Log: Reveals Power Law + Exponential Cutoff')
axes[0, 1].legend()

# Semilog-y - emphasizes exponential cutoff
axes[1, 0].semilogx(L, observed_phi, '.', markersize=1, alpha=0.5)
axes[1, 0].semilogx(L, phi, 'r-', linewidth=2)
axes[1, 0].set_xlabel('Luminosity (L☉)')
axes[1, 0].set_ylabel('Φ (Number density)')
axes[1, 0].set_title('Semilog-X: Emphasizes Bright End Cutoff')

# Custom: log-log with ratio to model
ratio = observed_phi / phi
axes[1, 1].semilogx(L, ratio, '.', markersize=1, alpha=0.5)
axes[1, 1].axhline(y=1, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

:class: question

You have data showing radioactive decay: counts versus time. Which scale would best reveal the half-life?

:::{dropdown} Answer
**Semilog-y (linear time, log counts)** is the best choice!

Radioactive decay follows N(t) = N₀ * e^(-λt), which becomes:
log(N) = log(N₀) - λt

On a semilog-y plot, this appears as a straight line with slope -λ. The half-life is clearly visible as the time for the counts to drop by half (constant vertical distance on the log scale).

```python
t = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)
N0 = 1000
half_life = 1.5
decay_rate = np.log(2) / half_life
counts = N0 * np.exp(-decay_rate * t)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))

# Linear - curve makes half-life hard to read
ax1.plot(t, counts)
ax1.set_title('Linear: Half-life unclear')

# Semilog-y - straight line, half-life obvious
ax2.semilogy(t, counts)
ax2.axhline(y=N0/2, color='r', linestyle='--', label=f't₁/₂ = {half_life}')
ax2.set_title('Semilog-y: Half-life clear!')
ax2.legend()

:::{admonition} 💡 Computational Thinking Box: DRY Principle in Plotting
:class: tip

**PATTERN: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**

Every time you copy-paste plotting code, you're creating technical debt. Instead, abstract common patterns into functions:

```python
# BAD: Copying and modifying
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(data1)
ax.set_xlabel('Time (s)')
ax.set_ylabel('Flux')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
# ... 50 lines later, same code with data2

# GOOD: Reusable function
def plot_time_series(data, xlabel='Time (s)', ylabel='Flux', **kwargs):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(**kwargs)
    ax.plot(data)
    ax.set_xlabel(xlabel)
    ax.set_ylabel(ylabel)
    ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
    return fig, ax

# Now you can customize without repetition
fig1, ax1 = plot_time_series(data1, ylabel='X-ray Flux')
fig2, ax2 = plot_time_series(data2, ylabel='Optical Flux')
```

Benefits:
- Consistency across all your plots
- Easy to update style everywhere at once
- Encode domain knowledge (like inverting magnitude axis)
- Share with collaborators
- Build your reputation for quality figures

## 8.5 Essential Plot Types for Astronomy

{margin} **Light Curve**
A plot showing how an object's brightness varies over time.

{margin} **Spectrum**
A plot showing intensity as a function of wavelength or frequency.

### Line Plots: Time Series and Spectra

**Line plots** are workhorses for astronomical data:

```{code-cell} python
# Generate realistic stellar spectrum
np.random.seed(42)
wavelength = np.linspace(4000, 7000, 1000)  # Angstroms
continuum = 1 - 0.0001 * (wavelength - 5500)**2 / 1e6  # Continuum shape

# Add absorption lines (H-alpha, H-beta, etc.)
lines = [(6563, 50, 0.3), (4861, 30, 0.25), (4340, 25, 0.2)]  # center, width, depth
spectrum = continuum.copy()
for center, width, depth in lines:
    spectrum *= (1 - depth * np.exp(-0.5 * ((wavelength - center) / width)**2))

# Add noise
spectrum += np.random.normal(0, 0.01, len(wavelength))

# Create publication-quality spectrum plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 5))

ax.plot(wavelength, spectrum, 'k-', linewidth=0.8, label='Observed')
ax.axhline(y=1, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, label='Continuum')

# Mark important lines
for center, width, depth in lines:
    ax.axvline(x=center, color='red', linestyle=':', alpha=0.5)
    ax.text(center, 0.65, f'{center}Å', rotation=90, 
            va='bottom', ha='right', fontsize=9)

ax.set_xlabel('Wavelength (Å)', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Normalized Flux', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('Stellar Spectrum with Balmer Lines', fontsize=14)
ax.set_xlim(4000, 7000)
ax.set_ylim(0.6, 1.1)
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.2)
ax.legend(loc='lower right')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Scatter Plots: Correlations and Diagrams

**Scatter plots** reveal relationships between variables:

```{code-cell} python
# Create a color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
np.random.seed(42)

# Main sequence stars
n_ms = 500
color_ms = np.random.uniform(-0.3, 2.0, n_ms)

mag_rg = np.random.normal(0, 0.5, n_rg)

# White dwarfs
n_wd = 50
color_wd = np.random.uniform(-0.3, 0.5, n_wd)
mag_wd = np.random.normal(11, 0.5, n_wd)

# Create the CMD
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 10))

ax.scatter(color_ms, mag_ms, c='navy', s=10, alpha=0.6, label='Main Sequence')
ax.scatter(color_rg, mag_rg, c='red', s=30, alpha=0.7, label='Red Giants')
ax.scatter(color_wd, mag_wd, c='lightblue', s=20, alpha=0.8, label='White Dwarfs')

ax.set_xlabel('B - V Color Index', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('V Magnitude', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('Color-Magnitude Diagram\n(Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram)', fontsize=14)
ax.invert_yaxis()  # Astronomical convention
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax.legend(loc='upper left')

# Add annotations
ax.annotate('Turn-off point', xy=(0.6, 6), xytext=(1.2, 7),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='black', alpha=0.5))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

:::{admonition} 🔍 Check Your Understanding
:class: question

What's the difference between `plt.plot()` and `ax.plot()`? When would you use each?

:::{dropdown} Answer
- `plt.plot()` uses the pyplot interface and operates on the "current" axes
- `ax.plot()` uses the object-oriented interface and explicitly specifies which axes to use

Use `plt.plot()` for:
- Quick, exploratory plots
- Simple single-panel figures
- Interactive work in Jupyter notebooks

Use `ax.plot()` for:
- Multi-panel figures
- Publication-quality plots
- Any situation where you need fine control
- Scripts that generate many figures

In research, always prefer `ax.plot()` for reproducibility and control!

:::{admonition} 🌟 Why This Matters: Finding Exoplanets in Pixels
:class: info, important

The Kepler Space Telescope (Borucki et al. 2010) discovered over 2,600 exoplanets not through pretty pictures, but through careful analysis of pixel data. Each star was just a few pixels on the CCD, and the challenge was detecting brightness changes of 0.01% buried in noise.

The key was visualization. The Kepler team developed specialized image displays showing:
1. The target pixel file (TPF) - raw pixel values over time
2. The optimal aperture - which pixels to sum for photometry
3. The background estimation - critical for accurate measurements

```python
# Simplified Kepler pixel analysis
# Create synthetic stellar image with transit
time_points = 50
image_size = 11
images = np.zeros((time_points, image_size, image_size))

# Add star (Gaussian PSF)
x, y = np.mgrid[0:image_size, 0:image_size]
star_x, star_y = 5, 5
for t in range(time_points):
    psf = 1000 * np.exp(-((x - star_x)**2 + (y - star_y)**2) / 4)
    
    # Add transit dip
    if 20 < t < 25:
        psf *= 0.99  # 1% dip
    
    images[t] = psf + np.random.normal(0, 5, (image_size, image_size))

# Optimal aperture (pixels to sum)
aperture = ((x - star_x)**2 + (y - star_y)**2) < 6

# Extract light curve
light_curve = [img[aperture].sum() for img in images]
```

This pixel-level visualization revealed not just transiting planets, but also asteroseismology signals, stellar rotation, and even reflected light from hot Jupiters. The ability to visualize and understand pixel data literally opened up new worlds!

:::{admonition} 🔍 Check Your Understanding
:class: question

Why is the 'jet' colormap problematic for scientific visualization?

:::{dropdown} Answer
The 'jet' colormap has several serious issues (Wong 2011):

1. **Not perceptually uniform**: Equal steps in data don't appear as equal steps in color
2. **Creates false features**: Bright bands at yellow and cyan create artificial boundaries
3. **Not colorblind-friendly**: Red-green confusion affects ~8% of males
4. **Poor grayscale conversion**: Loses information when printed in black and white

Example of the problem:
```python
# Linear data appears to have features with jet
linear_data = np.outer(np.ones(10), np.arange(100))

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
ax1.imshow(linear_data, cmap='jet', aspect='auto')
ax1.set_title('Jet: False features appear')
ax2.imshow(linear_data, cmap='viridis', aspect='auto')
ax2.set_title('Viridis: Smooth gradient')
```

Always use perceptually uniform colormaps like viridis, plasma, or cividis for scientific data!

:::{admonition} 🌟 Why This Matters: The Hubble Tension Revealed Through Visualization
:class: info, important

The "Hubble tension" — the discrepancy between different measurements of the universe's expansion rate — wasn't discovered through complex statistics but through careful visualization of measurement uncertainties. When plotting H₀ measurements from different methods (CMB, supernovae, gravitational lensing), the error bars don't overlap, revealing a fundamental problem in our understanding of cosmology. Your ability to create clear, honest visualizations with proper error bars might help resolve one of astronomy's biggest mysteries!
:::

## Main Takeaways

You've now mastered the art and science of data visualization with Matplotlib, but more importantly, you've learned to think like a visual artist-scientist. The journey from simple plots to publication-ready figures has taught you that visualization isn't just about displaying data — it's about experimentation, iteration, and making deliberate aesthetic choices that enhance scientific communication. You've discovered that creating effective visualizations requires trying multiple approaches: different scales (linear, log, semilog), different plot types (scatter, line, histogram), and different visual encodings (color, size, transparency) until you find the combination that makes patterns jump off the page. This experimental mindset, combined with the technical skills you've developed, transforms you from someone who makes plots into someone who crafts visual arguments that can change how we understand the universe.

The distinction between Matplotlib's two interfaces — pyplot and object-oriented — initially seemed like unnecessary complexity, but you now understand it's about control and reproducibility. While pyplot suffices for quick exploration, the object-oriented approach gives you the artist's palette you need for research-quality visualizations. You've seen how professional figures require attention to countless details: choosing perceptually uniform colormaps over the problematic jet (Crameri et al. 2020), using appropriate scales to reveal power laws or exponential relationships, properly labeling axes with units, and following astronomical conventions like inverting magnitude axes. These aren't arbitrary rules but hard-won practices that ensure your visualizations communicate honestly and effectively. The famous anatomy figure by Nicolas P. Rougier (2018) that you studied shows how every element — from figure to axes to individual tick marks — is under your control, waiting for your artistic vision.

Most importantly, you've learned to build your own plotting toolkit, creating reusable functions that encode your domain knowledge and aesthetic preferences. Instead of copy-pasting code and creating technical debt, you now write functions like `plot_light_curve()` or `plot_spectrum()` that embody best practices and can be shared with collaborators. This approach follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, ensuring consistency across all your visualizations while making it easy to update styles globally. These personal plotting libraries become more valuable over time, accumulating the wisdom of what works for different types of astronomical data. Whether you're phase-folding light curves to find exoplanets, creating color-magnitude diagrams to study stellar populations, or displaying multi-wavelength observations to understand cosmic phenomena, you have both the technical skills and the artistic sensibility to create visualizations that don't just show data but tell stories.

Looking ahead to robust computing, the visualization skills you've developed become essential debugging tools. When your code fails or produces unexpected results, a well-chosen plot can instantly reveal where things went wrong. The ability to quickly visualize intermediate results, check distributions, and compare expected versus actual outputs will make you a more effective debugger and a more reliable scientific programmer. Remember that every great astronomical discovery — from the expanding universe (Hubble 1929) to dark energy (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) to exoplanets (Borucki et al. 2010) — was communicated through a carefully crafted visualization. The skills you've developed here put you in that tradition, able to create the kinds of plots that don't just illustrate findings but reveal new truths about the cosmos.

## Definitions

**Axes**: The plotting area within a figure where data is visualized, including the x and y axis, tick marks, and labels.

**Backend**: The rendering engine Matplotlib uses to create and display figures (e.g., Agg, TkAgg, Qt5Agg).

**Colormap**: A mapping from data values to colors for visualization, critical for representing 2D data and images.

**DPI**: Dots per inch, determining figure resolution for printing or display, typically 72 for screen and 300+ for print.

**Experimentation**: The iterative process of trying different visualizations to find the most revealing representation.

**Figure**: The overall container for all plot elements, like a canvas that holds one or more axes.

**GridSpec**: Matplotlib's flexible system for creating complex subplot layouts with varying sizes and positions.

**LaTeX**: A typesetting system commonly used for scientific publications, supported by Matplotlib for mathematical notation.

**Light Curve**: A plot showing how an astronomical object's brightness varies over time.

**Linear Scale**: Equal steps in data correspond to equal distances on the plot.

**Logarithmic Scale**: Equal multiplicative factors correspond to equal distances on the plot.

**Normalization**: Scaling data values to a standard range for display, such as linear, logarithmic, or power scaling.

**Object-Oriented API**: Matplotlib's powerful interface providing full control over every plot element through explicit objects.

**Power Law**: A mathematical relationship where y ∝ x^n, appearing as a straight line on a log-log plot.

**pyplot**: Matplotlib's MATLAB-like procedural interface for quick plotting using implicit current figure/axes.

**Spectrum**: A plot showing intensity as a function of wavelength or frequency, fundamental in astronomical spectroscopy.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Matplotlib is your artistic medium** — Every plot is an opportunity for creative expression and experimentation

✓ **Always experiment with different scales** — Linear, log-log, semilog-x, and semilog-y reveal different patterns in your data

✓ **Use the object-oriented interface for research** — `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` gives you explicit control needed for publication

✓ **Build reusable plotting functions** — Create your own library encoding best practices for common astronomical plots

✓ **Choose perceptually uniform colormaps** — Use viridis, plasma, or cividis; avoid jet which creates false features

✓ **Master the anatomy of figures** — Understanding Rougier's diagram empowers you to customize every element

✓ **Different plots for different data** — Use scatter for measurements, lines for models, histograms for distributions

✓ **Save in appropriate formats** — Vector (PDF, SVG) for plots, raster (PNG) for images, both for safety

✓ **Follow astronomical conventions** — Invert magnitude axes, use proper coordinate systems, follow field standards

✓ **Visualization reveals patterns** — The right plot can make invisible relationships obvious, leading to discoveries

## Next Chapter Preview

In Chapter 9: Robust Computing - Writing Reliable Scientific Code, you'll learn how to transform your scripts from fragile prototypes into robust, reliable tools that can handle the messiness of real astronomical data. You'll master error handling with try-except blocks, learning to gracefully manage missing files, corrupted data, and numerical edge cases that would otherwise crash your analysis. You'll discover defensive programming techniques that validate inputs, check assumptions, and fail informatively when something goes wrong. Most importantly, you'll learn to write code that helps you debug problems quickly — using logging instead of print statements, creating useful error messages, and structuring your code to isolate failures. The visualization skills you've developed with Matplotlib will become powerful debugging tools, helping you create diagnostic plots that reveal where your code is failing and why. These skills are essential for research computing, where your code needs to process thousands of files from telescopes, handle incomplete observations, and work with data that's often messier than textbook examples. You'll learn that robust code isn't about preventing all errors — it's about failing gracefully, recovering when possible, and always giving you enough information to understand what went wrong!
