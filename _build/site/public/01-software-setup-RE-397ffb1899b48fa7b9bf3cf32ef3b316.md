## Setup Roadmap

Total time: ~60 minutes

:::{admonition} Your Setup Journey
:class: tip

üì¶ **Step 1**: Install Python with Miniforge (15 min)  
üåç **Step 2**: Create your course environment (10 min)  
üìù **Step 3**: Install VS Code editor (10 min)  
‚úÖ **Step 4**: Verify everything works (5 min)  
üöÄ **Step 5**: Quick practice session (20 min)
:::

## Understanding the Setup (2-minute read)

Your computer probably already has Python, but it's used by your operating system. Touching it could break things. We need:

- **Our own Python**: Separate from system Python (that's what Miniforge provides)
- **Isolated workspace**: A bubble for course packages (that's the conda environment)  
- **Code editor**: A professional tool for writing code (that's VS Code)

Think of it like setting up a chemistry lab‚Äîyou need the right equipment in a clean, isolated space where experiments won't affect anything else.

- [Why use conda environments?](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)
```

```{admonition} üí° Keep This Open
:class: note

**Terminal Basics** (you'll need these commands throughout):
- Where am I? ‚Üí `pwd`
- What's here? ‚Üí `ls`  
- Move to folder ‚Üí `cd foldername`
- Go back ‚Üí `cd ..`
- Copy-paste works! (Ctrl+Shift+V on Linux/Windows, Cmd+V on Mac)
```

## Step 1: Install Python via Miniforge

Miniforge gives us:
- Python + conda package manager (same as Anaconda/Miniconda)
- Free, open-source, no licensing issues
- Works identically on all operating systems
- Default conda-forge channel (community-maintained, most comprehensive)
- Minimal installation (~400 MB vs Anaconda's ~3 GB)

:::{admonition} ü§î Why Miniforge instead of Anaconda?
:class: note, dropdown

**Miniforge** (~400 MB): Just Python + conda + pip. You install only what you need.
**Anaconda** (~3 GB): Pre-installs 250+ packages (Spyder, Qt, R packages, etc.) you won't use.
**Miniconda** (~400 MB): Minimal like Miniforge but defaults to Anaconda's channel (fewer packages).

Anaconda also has commercial licensing restrictions for organizations >200 people.

For academic work, Miniforge is the best choice: minimal, free, and access to the most packages. [Learn more about conda variants](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: tab2

:::{admonition} ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Users: Important Notes
:class: warning

1. The instructor uses macOS/Linux and hasn't personally tested these Windows instructions
2. Most commands work in "Git Bash" (install Git first if needed)
3. Use "Miniforge Prompt" for pure conda operations
4. If you encounter issues:
   - Google the exact error message (in quotes)
   - Ask ChatGPT/Claude with the full error text
   - Post on Slack with screenshots
   - Find a Windows-using classmate!
:::

**1. Download installer:**

- Visit https://conda-forge.org/download/
- Click the "Windows x86_64" installer 
- The .exe file (~80 MB) will download to your Downloads folder

**2. Verify download:**
- Open File Explorer ‚Üí Downloads folder
- Look for Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe
- If the file is &lt;70 MB, the download failed - try again

**3. Run the installer:**
- Double-click the .exe file
- If you get security warnings, click "Run anyway"
- Right-click ‚Üí "Run as Administrator" if you encounter permission issues

**4. Installation wizard:**
- Click Next

- Use default location
- ‚úì Check "Add Miniforge3 to PATH"
- Install

**5. Open "Miniforge Prompt" from Start Menu**

**6. Verify installation:**
```bash
conda --version
```
‚úÖ **Success**: Shows version number like `conda 24.7.1`
:::
::::

:::{admonition} ‚ö†Ô∏è Didn't Work?
:class: warning

If `conda --version` gives "command not found":
1. **Restart your terminal** (most common fix)
2. Check installation path matches what you selected
3. On Windows, use "Miniforge Prompt" not regular Command Prompt
:::

## Step 2: Create Your Course Environment

:::{admonition} ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep Your Terminal Open!
:class: warning

Use the same terminal window throughout setup. If you accidentally close it:

1. Open a new terminal
2. Run `conda activate astr596` (after creating it)
3. Continue where you left off
:::

An environment is an isolated workspace. Think of it as a clean room where we can install packages without affecting anything else on your computer.

```bash
# Create environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n astr596 python=3.11
```

When prompted "Proceed ([y]/n)?", type `y` and press Enter.

```bash
# Activate your environment
conda activate astr596
```

‚úÖ **Success Check**: Your prompt now shows `(astr596)` at the beginning

:::{admonition} ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake #1
:class: warning

**Forgetting to activate the environment!**

Every time you open a new terminal, you MUST run:

```bash
conda activate astr596
```

No (astr596) in prompt = wrong environment = packages "not found"!
:::

### Install Essential Packages

:::{admonition} ‚è±Ô∏è Installation Time
:class: note

Package installation takes 5-15 minutes depending on internet speed.
If it's taking longer than 20 minutes:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try again with fewer packages at once
:::

You have two options for package installation:

#### Option 1: Install Everything Now (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all course packages at once
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyter ipython astropy h5py scikit-learn

# Install JAX and jax-related packages separately (can be finicky)
conda install jax jaxlib -c conda-forge
conda install flax optax diffrax lineax optimistix -c conda-forge

# If JAX fails with conda, use pip as fallback:
# pip install --upgrade jax jaxlib
```

*This ensures you won't forget to install something later when you need it!*

#### Option 2: Progressive Installation

Start with core packages and add others as needed:

```bash
# Essential packages (install these now)
conda install numpy matplotlib jupyter ipython
```

Add more when you need them:
```bash
# Scientific computing (Project 2+)
conda install scipy pandas astropy

# Machine learning (Project 3+)
conda install scikit-learn h5py
conda install jax jaxlib -c conda-forge
```

### Managing Packages

:::{admonition} üì¶ Package Management Commands
:class: tip

**Update packages** (do this periodically):

```bash
conda update numpy
conda update --all  # Update everything
```

**Uninstall packages** (useful for troubleshooting):
```bash
conda uninstall package_name
# Then reinstall fresh:
conda install package_name
```

**Check what's installed**:
```bash
conda list  # All packages
conda list numpy  # Specific package version
```
:::

‚úÖ **Quick Test**:
```bash
python -c "import numpy; print('NumPy works!')"
```

## Step 3: Install and Configure VS Code

### Installation

1. Download from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Run installer for your operating system
3. Launch VS Code

### Minimal Setup (That's All You Need!)

1. **Install Python Extension**:
   - Click Extensions icon in sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search "Python"
   - Install "Python" by Microsoft (first result)

2. **Select Your Environment**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Choose `astr596` from the list
   - **Note**: VS Code remembers this choice per folder - set once per project!

That's it! Add other extensions only as you need them.

### Disable AI Assistants (Course Requirement)

:::{admonition} üö´ Critical: Disable ALL AI Coding Tools
:class: important

**Why this matters**: AI assistants like GitHub Copilot will autocomplete your code, often suggesting entire functions or completing lines automatically. While this seems helpful, it's catastrophic for learning because:

- You'll type `def` and Copilot writes the entire function (often incorrectly)
- You won't develop problem-solving skills or debugging abilities
- You'll become dependent on suggestions rather than understanding
- The AI often suggests plausible-looking but subtly wrong code

**This course's philosophy**: Learn to think computationally first, then use AI as a tool later (after Week 8).

**To disable**:
1. Press `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (Mac) for Settings
2. Search "copilot" ‚Üí Uncheck ALL "Enable" options
3. Search "intellicode" ‚Üí Uncheck "Enable"  
4. Search "ai" ‚Üí Disable any AI suggestions or completions
5. Search "suggest" ‚Üí Consider disabling autocompletion entirely for maximum learning

You're here to train your brain, not to train an AI to write code for you.
:::

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Create a simple test file to verify everything works:

**1. Create `test_setup.py`:**

```python
"""Quick setup test for ASTR 596"""
print("Testing imports...")

import numpy as np
print("‚úì NumPy works!")

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("‚úì Matplotlib works!")

# Only test JAX if you installed it
try:
    import jax
    print("‚úì JAX works!")
except ImportError:
    print("‚óã JAX not installed (that's okay for now)")

print("\nüéâ Everything is installed correctly!")
print("Your environment is ready for ASTR 596!")
```

**2. Run the test:**

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

‚úÖ **Success**: You see checkmarks and the success message!

## Step 5: Quick Practice

Let's make sure you're comfortable with the basics:

```bash
# 1. Check your environment is active
conda activate astr596

# 2. Check what's installed
conda list

# 3. Create a simple plot
python -c "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.plot([1,2,3]); plt.savefig('test.png'); print('Created test.png')"

# 4. Open VS Code in current folder
code .
```

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete Checklist

You're ready for the course when:

- [ ] Opening a new terminal and typing `conda activate astr596` works
- [ ] The prompt shows `(astr596)` after activation
- [ ] Running `python -c "import numpy"` produces no errors
- [ ] VS Code opens when you type `code .`
- [ ] The test script runs successfully

**All checked?** You're ready! 

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've just accomplished what many graduate students struggle with for weeks. Your professional development environment is now:

- ‚úÖ **Isolated** from system Python (no conflicts!)
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible** (same setup works on any machine)
- ‚úÖ **Professional-grade** (same tools as research scientists)

Take a screenshot of your successful test script output‚Äîyou've earned this victory!

## Troubleshooting

:::{admonition} üîß Common Issues and Solutions
:class: dropdown

**"Command not found: conda"**
- Restart your terminal (most common fix!)
- On Windows, use "Miniforge Prompt" not regular Command Prompt
- Check if installation completed successfully

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named numpy"**
- Check prompt shows `(astr596)` - if not, run `conda activate astr596`
- Verify package is installed: `conda list numpy`
- Reinstall if needed: `conda install numpy`

**VS Code can't find Python**
- Open Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P)
- Run "Python: Select Interpreter"
- Choose the astr596 environment
- Restart VS Code if needed

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Don't use `sudo` with conda (ever!)
- On Windows, try "Run as Administrator" for installer only
- Check you own the Miniforge directory

**Package installation fails**
- Update conda first: `conda update conda`
- Clear cache: `conda clean --all`
- Try installing packages one at a time
- Last resort for specific package: `pip install packagename`

**Behind a corporate/university firewall?**
```bash
# Configure proxy (replace with your proxy details)
conda config --set proxy_servers.http http://proxy.yourorg.com:8080
conda config --set proxy_servers.https https://proxy.yourorg.com:8080
```

**Need to start over completely?**
```bash
# Remove environment and start fresh
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n astr596
# Then go back to Step 2
```

**Low on disk space?**
```bash
# Remove unused packages and cache
conda clean --all
# Check environment size
du -sh ~/miniforge3/envs/astr596
```

## What's Next?

:::{admonition} üõë Feeling Overwhelmed?
:class: tip, dropdown

It's okay to take a break after Step 2 (environment creation) and continue tomorrow.
Your progress is saved! When you return:

1. Open a new terminal
2. Run `conda activate astr596`
3. Continue from where you left off
:::

1. ‚úÖ Environment is ready
2. ‚Üí Continue to [Git and GitHub Guide](02-git-intro-guide)

:::{admonition} üí° Pro Tips
:class: success

**Save Time**: Add this to your terminal config file (.bashrc/.zshrc):
```bash
alias astr="conda activate astr596"
```
Now just type `astr` to activate!

**Stay Organized**: Create a folder structure:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/astr596/{projects,notes,data}
```

**Practice Daily**: Open terminal every day, even for 5 minutes. Muscle memory develops fast!
