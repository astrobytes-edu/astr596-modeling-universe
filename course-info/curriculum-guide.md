## Why This Course is Designed the Way It Is

### The Big Picture: Your Learning Journey Through Computational Astrophysics

This course is designed with a specific progression in mind: **Fundamentals → Classical Methods → Statistical Methods → Modern ML**. This mirrors how the field itself evolved, but more importantly, each topic builds essential skills for the next. You'll essentially recreate the historical development of computational physics, but in a compressed, logical sequence that maximizes your learning.

**Why are we sharing this with you?** We believe in transparency. This document shows you the thought process behind every topic choice, timing, and connection. Understanding the "why" behind your curriculum will help you see the forest through the trees and appreciate how each assignment builds toward your growth as a computational scientist.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)

### **Python/OOP and Stellar Physics**

You'll start with stellar physics because it's conceptually accessible - everyone intuitively understands that hot things glow and massive things attract. But here's the educational design at work: implementing a `Star` class teaches you object-oriented thinking naturally. A star has properties (`mass`, `temperature`, `luminosity`) and methods (`evolve`, `radiate`, `calculate_lifetime`). This makes OOP concrete rather than abstract.

The stellar physics will introduce key concepts you'll use throughout the course:

- **Scaling relations** ($L ∝ M^{3.5}$) prepare you for power laws in ML

- **Equilibrium conditions** (hydrostatic balance) introduce the idea of optimization

- **Time evolution** sets up for numerical integration next week

### **N-Body Dynamics**

This becomes your introduction to numerical methods. N-body dynamics is perfectly positioned here because:

1. **The physics is simple**: $F = \tfrac{GMm}{r²}$ - everyone gets this
2. **The computational challenge is real**: can't solve analytically for $N>2$
3. **Introduces fundamental numerical concepts**:
   - Discretization (time steps)
   - Integration schemes (Euler → Verlet → Runge-Kutta)
   - Error accumulation and energy conservation
   - Computational complexity ($O(N²)$ naive vs $O(N\log N)$ tree codes)

You'll discover firsthand why algorithm choice matters when your solar system flies apart using Euler integration but remains stable with Verlet. This visceral experience of numerical stability will stay with you throughout the course.

## Phase 2: Bridge to Statistics (Weeks 4-6)

### **Monte Carlo Methods**

This serves as the perfect bridge topic. Monte Carlo connects deterministic physics to statistical thinking. You're still solving physics problems, but now using random sampling. You'll learn:

- **Random sampling as a computational tool** (computing $π$ by throwing darts)
- **Importance sampling** (sample where it matters)
- **Variance reduction** (smart sampling beats brute force)
- **The power of statistical approaches** to deterministic problems

This prepares your mind for the probabilistic thinking required in machine learning, while still feeling like "physics."

### **Linear Regression/ML Fundamentals**

Now you'll make the leap to data-driven methods, but regression is familiar enough not to overwhelm you. Here's what makes this placement perfect in your learning journey:

Starting from scratch means deriving the normal equation $(X^T X)β = X^T y$, which shows:

- **Linear algebra underpins everything** in ML
- **Optimization** (minimizing squared error) - your first loss function!
- **Gradient descent** - THE fundamental algorithm of deep learning
- **Overfitting** - why more complex isn't always better
- **Regularization** (Ridge/Lasso) - controlling model complexity

By building this from `numpy` arrays rather than using `sklearn`, you'll understand that ML isn't magic - it's just math and code.

## Phase 3: Advanced Statistical Methods (Weeks 7-10)

### **Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer**

This is where things get beautiful. Radiative transfer combines everything you've learned:

- Monte Carlo methods (photon packets)
- Object-oriented design (`Photon` class, `Grid` class)
- Physical insight (scattering, absorption)
- Statistical thinking (sampling optical depths)

MCRT is how astronomers actually model real observations - from stellar atmospheres to galaxy formation. You'll see your code produce synthetic observations that look like real telescope data. This connection between your code and real science is incredibly motivating.

### **Bayesian Inference and MCMC**

This represents the intellectual peak of the course. Bayesian thinking will fundamentally change how you see uncertainty and inference. You'll learn:

**Bayesian Fundamentals**:

- Prior beliefs + Data = Updated beliefs (conceptually)
- Bayes Law: $P(\text{model|data}) ∝ P(\text{data|model}) × P(\text{model})$
- Everything is a probability distribution, not a single number

**MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)**:
This is where minds get blown. MCMC solves the problem: "I can calculate $P(θ|\text{data})$ but I can't integrate it analytically to get parameter distributions."

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is surprisingly simple:

1. Propose new parameters.
2. Calculate likelihood ratio.
3. Accept/reject based on ratio.
4. Repeat until convergence.

But the implications are profound - suddenly you can fit models with hundreds of parameters, get full uncertainty distributions, and do model comparison. This is how astronomers measure dark energy, find exoplanets, and determine stellar parameters.

## Phase 4: Modern Machine Learning (Overview - Weeks 11-16)

### **Gaussian Processes**

Gaussian Processes serve as the perfect bridge between classical statistics and modern ML. They're still Bayesian (everything is distributions) but now you're learning functions, not parameters.

A GP is basically saying: "I don't know the function $f(x)$, but I know it's smooth, and here's my uncertainty everywhere." It's like having error bars on your interpolation. In astronomy, GPs are used for:

- Removing stellar variability from exoplanet data.
- Interpolating sparse observations.
- Quantifying uncertainty in predictions.

The covariance function (kernel) determines your prior beliefs about smoothness, periodicity, etc. This connects to the kernel trick in SVMs and prepares you for thinking about feature spaces.

### **Neural Networks from Scratch**

This is your culmination. In your final project, you'll build a neural network using only `JAX`, understanding every piece:

**Forward propagation**:

- Linear transformation: $z = Wx + b$
- Non-linearity: $a = σ(z)$
- Stack these to get deep networks

**Backpropagation** (the key insight):
Using the chain rule to propagate errors backwards:

- $∂L/∂W = ∂L/∂z × ∂z/∂W$
- This is just calculus, not magic!

You'll implement:

- Gradient descent variants (SGD, momentum, Adam).
- Different architectures (fully connected, CNN basics).
- Regularization (dropout, batch norm).

### **JAX and Modern Tools**

Finally, you'll see how your from-scratch implementations translate to modern tools. JAX is perfect for this because:

- It looks like numpy (familiar!)
- But adds automatic differentiation (grad(f) just works!)
- And JIT compilation (100x speedups)
- And easy GPU usage

You'll see that your hand-coded backpropagation is exactly what `jax.grad()` does, but faster. This demystifies modern frameworks while showing their power.

## Why This Progression Works

1. **Each topic motivates the next**: Numerical integration struggles motivate Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo motivates statistics. Statistics motivates ML.
2. **Complexity ramps gradually**: Start with $F=ma$, end with training neural networks, but each step is manageable.
3. **Theory and practice interleave**: Implement first, understand deeply, see limitations, motivate next method.
4. **Real astrophysics throughout**: Every algorithm solves actual astronomy problems, maintaining relevance and motivation.
5. **Modern skills emerge from fundamentals**: By the end, you aren't just using the `JAX`ecosystem (e.g., `Flax`, `Optax`) - you'll understand what these tools are doing *under* the hood.

This progression takes you from "I can code physics" to "I can implement any algorithm from a paper" - which is exactly what research requires. You're not just learning techniques; you're building computational intuition and confidence.

**Special note**: Pay particular attention to weeks 9-10 (Bayesian/MCMC) and 11-12 (Gaussian Processes) as these are where classical scientific computing meets modern ML. These topics will deepen your ML understanding more than any pure ML course because you'll understand the statistical foundations that deep learning often glosses over.

## Understanding the Course Architecture

This course represents a carefully orchestrated progression through computational astrophysics and machine learning (ML), where each topic serves as both a destination and a stepping stone in your learning journey. Your path from classical deterministic physics to modern probabilistic machine learning mirrors the historical development of computational science, but compressed into a single semester. More importantly, this progression builds your mathematical maturity and computational intuition in a way that makes each new concept feel like a natural extension of what you've already learned.

The strength of this structure lies in how it interweaves three threads: the physics provides concrete motivation and real-world context, the mathematics provides the rigorous foundation, and the computation provides the practical skills you'll need. No topic exists in isolation — each one reinforces and extends the others, creating a web of understanding in your mind rather than a linear sequence of disconnected techniques.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1-2: Python, Object-Oriented Programming, and Stellar Physics

#### Mathematical Foundations (Stellar Physics)

The stellar physics component introduces you to power laws and scaling relations, which appear throughout astrophysics and machine learning. The fundamental stellar structure equations provide a perfect playground for understanding how physical constraints translate to code structure.

The mass-luminosity relation, $L ∝ M^α$ where $α ≈ 3.5$ for main sequence stars, introduces you to power law relationships. This seemingly simple relation emerges from complex physics: hydrostatic equilibrium $\left(dP/dr = -GMρ/r² \right)$, energy transport (either radiative diffusion or convection), and nuclear fusion rates that depend sensitively on temperature ($ε ∝ T^n$ where $n$ ranges from 4 for the PP chain to 20 for the CNO cycle).

The Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4πR²σT⁴$, teaches you about radiation physics while introducing the concept of effective temperature. This becomes crucial later when you'll implement radiative transfer. The relationship between mass, radius, and temperature for main sequence stars ($R ∝ M^{0.7}$, $T ∝ M^{0.5}$) emerges from solving the stellar structure equations for main-sequence stars, showing how complex systems can often be understood through dimensional analysis and scaling arguments.

#### Scientific Background (Stellar Physics)

Stars are self-gravitating balls of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), where the outward pressure gradient $\left(\tfrac{dP}{dr}\right)$ of a star with mass $M$ exactly balances the inward gravitational pull $\rho(r) g$ where $\rho(r)$ is the local density is the density and $g = \tfrac{GM(<r)}{r^2}$ is the local gravitational acceleration. This balance, expressed as

$$ dP/dr = -GMρ/r², $$

is our first differential equation. You'll learn that this simple equation, combined with energy generation and transport, determines a star's entire structure.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, plotting luminosity versus temperature, isn't just a classification scheme—it's a map of stellar physics. The main sequence represents hydrogen fusion equilibrium, the giant branch shows shell burning and envelope expansion, and white dwarfs demonstrate quantum degeneracy pressure. By implementing a simple stellar evolution model, you'll see how stars move through this parameter space over time.

#### Computational Implementation (Stellar Physics)

The object-oriented design emerges naturally from the physics. A Star class encapsulates properties (mass, temperature, luminosity, composition) and methods (evolve, calculate_luminosity, determine_lifetime). This teaches you that OOP isn't about abstract inheritance hierarchies—it's about modeling real systems with interacting components.

```python
class Star:
    def __init__(self, mass, metallicity=0.02):
        self.mass = mass  # in solar masses
        self.metallicity = metallicity
        self.age = 0
        self.phase = "main_sequence"
        
    def calculate_luminosity(self):
        """Main sequence mass-luminosity relation"""
        if self.mass < 0.43:
            return self.mass**2.3
        elif self.mass < 2:
            return self.mass**4
        else:
            return 1.4 * self.mass**3.5
            
    def evolve(self, dt):
        """Evolve star forward by time dt"""
        # Main sequence lifetime ∝ M/L ∝ M^(-2.5)
        ms_lifetime = 10e9 * self.mass**(-2.5)  # years
        self.age += dt
        
        if self.age > ms_lifetime:
            self.phase = "red_giant"
            # Implement post-main-sequence evolution
```

This code structure teaches modular thinking—each method does one thing well, making debugging and extension straightforward.

### Week 3: N-Body Dynamics and Numerical Integration

#### Mathematical Foundations (N-Body Dynamics)

N-body dynamics introduces the fundamental challenge of numerical methods: solving differential equations that have no analytical solution. For N gravitating bodies, we have a system of coupled second-order ODEs:

$$\frac{d^2\vec{r}_i}{dt^2} = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{Gm_j(\vec{r}_j - \vec{r}_i)}{|\vec{r}_j - \vec{r}_i|^3}$$

This vector equation represents $3N$ coupled second-order ODEs (or equivalently, $6N$ first-order ODEs when we include velocities). The seemingly simple $1/r^2$ force law leads to surprisingly complex dynamics—from stable orbits to chaotic trajectories.

The critical insight you'll gain is that discretization introduces error. The Euler method, $r(t+\Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t$, seems obvious but fails catastrophically for orbital dynamics. The local truncation error is $O(\Delta t^2)$, but more importantly, it doesn't conserve energy. You'll watch your planets spiral into the sun or escape to infinity, learning viscerally that algorithm choice matters.

The Verlet integration scheme, $r(t+\Delta t) = 2r(t) - r(t-\Delta t) + a(t)\Delta t^2$, is symplectic—it conserves phase space volume. This means errors in position and velocity are bounded rather than growing exponentially. The mathematics of symplectic integrators connects to Hamiltonian mechanics and Liouville's theorem, showing you that numerical methods aren't just recipes but have deep theoretical foundations.

#### Scientific Background (N-Body Dynamics)

The N-body problem is foundational to astronomy. From planetary systems to galaxy clusters, gravitational dynamics shapes the universe. The three-body problem's lack of general analytical solution (proven by Poincaré) demonstrates that even simple physical laws can produce intractable mathematics, motivating numerical approaches.

You'll implement increasingly complex scenarios: two-body orbits (testing Kepler's laws), the restricted three-body problem (introducing Lagrange points), and finally full N-body systems. You'll discover emergent phenomena like orbital resonances, tidal disruption, and dynamical relaxation. The computational cost scaling as $O(N^2)$ for direct summation motivates discussion of tree codes and fast multipole methods, connecting to computer science concepts like spatial data structures.

#### Computational Implementation (N-Body Dynamics)

The implementation teaches crucial numerical computing concepts:

```python
def leapfrog_integration(positions, velocities, masses, dt, n_steps):
    """
    Leapfrog integration - a symplectic integrator
    Positions and velocities are offset by dt/2
    """
    for step in range(n_steps):
        # Kick: update velocities by half step
        accelerations = compute_accelerations(positions, masses)
        velocities += accelerations * dt/2
        
        # Drift: update positions by full step
        positions += velocities * dt
        
        # Kick: update velocities by another half step
        accelerations = compute_accelerations(positions, masses)
        velocities += accelerations * dt/2
        
    return positions, velocities

def compute_accelerations(positions, masses):
    """
    Compute gravitational accelerations for all particles
    This is the O(N²) bottleneck
    """
    n_particles = len(masses)
    accelerations = np.zeros_like(positions)
    
    for i in range(n_particles):
        for j in range(i+1, n_particles):
            # Vector from i to j
            dr = positions[j] - positions[i]
            r = np.linalg.norm(dr)
            
            # Gravitational acceleration (G=1 in computational units)
            a_mag = masses[j] / r**3
            
            # Update both particles (Newton's third law)
            accelerations[i] += a_mag * dr
            accelerations[j] -= (masses[i]/masses[j]) * a_mag * dr
            
    return accelerations
```

You'll learn about computational units (setting $G=1$, measuring distances in AU, time in years), numerical stability (why $r^3$ in the denominator rather than $r^2$ divided by $r$), and performance optimization (symmetry exploitation, vectorization).

---

## Phase 2: Bridge to Statistical Thinking (Weeks 4-6)

### Week 4: Monte Carlo Methods and Statistical Sampling

#### Mathematical Foundations (Monte Carlo Methods)

Monte Carlo methods rest on the profound insight that we can solve deterministic problems using random numbers. The mathematical foundation is the Law of Large Numbers: as we take more random samples, their average converges to the expected value.

The basic Monte Carlo integration formula transforms an integral into an expectation value:
$$\int_a^b f(x)dx \approx (b-a) \times \frac{1}{N}\sum f(x_i)$$

where x_i are uniformly distributed random points. The error decreases as $1/\sqrt{N}$ regardless of dimensionality, making Monte Carlo superior to deterministic quadrature for high-dimensional problems.

Importance sampling introduces a deeper concept: we can reduce variance by sampling from a distribution that resembles our integrand. If we sample from distribution p(x) instead of uniformly:
$$\int f(x)dx = \int \frac{f(x)}{p(x)}p(x)dx \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum \frac{f(x_i)}{p(x_i)}$$

The art lies in choosing p(x) to minimize variance while remaining easy to sample from. This concept reappears in MCMC, particle filters, and variational inference.

#### Scientific Background (Monte Carlo Methods)

Monte Carlo methods revolutionized radiation transport, nuclear physics, and statistical mechanics. The name comes from the Manhattan Project, where Ulam and von Neumann used random sampling to study neutron diffusion. In astrophysics, Monte Carlo is essential for modeling radiative transfer in complex geometries, cosmic ray propagation, and stellar population synthesis.

The pedagogical beauty of starting with Monte Carlo is that it bridges deterministic and probabilistic thinking. Computing $\pi$ by randomly throwing darts at a circle inscribed in a square gives you an intuitive feel for how randomness can yield precise answers. You'll learn that Monte Carlo isn't about getting lucky—it's about using the law of large numbers to your advantage.

#### Computational Implementation (Monte Carlo Methods)

You'll implement progressively sophisticated Monte Carlo algorithms:

```python
def monte_carlo_pi(n_samples):
    """
    Estimate π using Monte Carlo sampling
    Demonstrates basic MC principles
    """
    inside_circle = 0
    
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        x, y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, 2)
        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:
            inside_circle += 1
    
    # Area of circle / Area of square = π/4
    pi_estimate = 4 * inside_circle / n_samples
    
    # Standard error decreases as 1/√N
    std_error = np.sqrt(pi_estimate * (4 - pi_estimate) / n_samples)
    
    return pi_estimate, std_error

def importance_sampling_integral(f, p, sample_from_p, n_samples):
    """
    Integrate function f using importance sampling with distribution p
    This is the foundation for MCMC and particle filters
    """
    samples = [sample_from_p() for _ in range(n_samples)]
    weights = [f(x) / p(x) for x in samples]
    
    integral = np.mean(weights)
    variance = np.var(weights) / n_samples
    
    return integral, np.sqrt(variance)
```

Through these implementations, you'll discover key concepts: variance reduction techniques, the curse of dimensionality (though MC is less cursed than grid methods), and the trade-off between bias and variance.

---

### Weeks 5-6: Linear Regression and Machine Learning Fundamentals

#### Mathematical Foundations (Linear Regression)

Linear regression introduces the core mathematical framework of machine learning: optimization. The problem is to find parameters β that minimize the squared error:

$$L(\beta) = ||y - X\beta||^2 = (y - X\beta)^T(y - X\beta)$$

Taking the gradient and setting it to zero yields the normal equations:
$$X^T X \beta = X^T y$$

The solution $\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$ requires that $X^T X$ be invertible, introducing the concept of multicollinearity. This motivates regularization—adding a penalty term $\lambda||\beta||^2$ leads to Ridge regression:
$$\beta_{ridge} = (X^T X + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T y$$

The addition of $\lambda I$ guarantees invertibility while shrinking coefficients toward zero, our first encounter with the bias-variance tradeoff.

Gradient descent provides an iterative alternative:
$$\beta_{t+1} = \beta_t - \alpha\nabla L(\beta_t) = \beta_t + \alpha X^T(y - X\beta_t)$$

This simple update rule is the foundation of all deep learning. You'll learn about learning rates, convergence conditions, and the geometry of loss surfaces. The quadratic loss surface of linear regression has a unique global minimum (if $X^T X$ is invertible), but you'll implement examples where poor conditioning leads to slow convergence, foreshadowing challenges in neural network training.

#### Scientific Background (Linear Regression)

In astronomy, linear regression appears everywhere: fitting spectral lines to measure redshifts, determining period-luminosity relations for Cepheid variables, and calibrating photometric redshifts. But more importantly, regression introduces the conceptual framework for all supervised learning.

The method of least squares has a rich history dating to Gauss and Legendre's work on orbital determination. Gauss used it to recover the dwarf planet Ceres after it was lost in the sun's glare—one of the first "big data" problems in astronomy. The connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimation under Gaussian noise assumptions provides a probabilistic interpretation that prepares you for Bayesian methods.

#### Computational Implementation (Linear Regression)

Building regression from scratch demystifies machine learning:

```python
class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, regularization=0.0):
        """
        Linear regression with optional L2 regularization (Ridge)
        """
        self.regularization = regularization
        self.weights = None
        self.training_history = []
        
    def fit_closed_form(self, X, y):
        """
        Solve using normal equations: (X^T X + λI)^(-1) X^T y
        """
        n_features = X.shape[1]
        
        # Add regularization term to diagonal
        XtX = X.T @ X + self.regularization * np.eye(n_features)
        Xty = X.T @ y
        
        # Solve the system (more stable than inverting)
        self.weights = np.linalg.solve(XtX, Xty)
        
    def fit_gradient_descent(self, X, y, learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000):
        """
        Iterative optimization using gradient descent
        This is how neural networks are trained!
        """
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        
        for iteration in range(n_iterations):
            # Forward pass: compute predictions
            y_pred = X @ self.weights
            
            # Compute loss (MSE + regularization)
            loss = np.mean((y - y_pred)**2) + self.regularization * np.sum(self.weights**2)
            self.training_history.append(loss)
            
            # Backward pass: compute gradients
            gradient = -2/n_samples * X.T @ (y - y_pred) + 2*self.regularization*self.weights
            
            # Update weights
            self.weights -= learning_rate * gradient
            
            # Adaptive learning rate (basic version)

Through implementation, you'll discover practical issues: feature scaling, numerical stability, the importance of vectorization, and why we need train/validation/test splits. You'll see overfitting happen in real-time as you add polynomial features, motivating regularization and model selection.

## Phase 3: Deep Statistical Methods (Weeks 7-10)

### Weeks 7-8: Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer

#### Mathematical Foundations (Radiative Transfer)

Radiative transfer combines all previous concepts: Monte Carlo sampling, physical modeling, and statistical thinking. The radiative transfer equation describes how radiation propagates through a medium:

$$\frac{dI_\nu}{ds} = -\alpha_\nu I_\nu + j_\nu$$

where $I_\nu$ is specific intensity, $\alpha_\nu$ is the absorption coefficient, and $j_\nu$ is the emission coefficient. In scattering-dominated regimes, this becomes an integro-differential equation that's analytically intractable for realistic geometries.

Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) reformulates this as a random walk problem. Photons are packets of energy that propagate, scatter, and absorb stochastically. The optical depth $\tau$ determines interaction probabilities:
$$P(\tau) = e^{-\tau}$$

Sampling path lengths from this exponential distribution:
$$l = -\frac{\ln(\xi)}{\alpha}$$

where $\xi$ is a uniform random number. This transforms the deterministic PDE into a statistical sampling problem.

Scattering introduces angular redistribution. For Thomson scattering (electrons) or Rayleigh scattering (atoms), the phase function determines the scattering angle distribution. For dust grains, Mie theory provides complex angular distributions that you must sample efficiently using techniques like rejection sampling or inverse transform sampling.

#### Scientific Background (Radiative Transfer)

Radiative transfer is how we understand everything we see in astronomy. From stellar atmospheres to protoplanetary disks to cosmological reionization, radiation transport shapes observations. MCRT handles arbitrary 3D geometries, making it essential for modeling real astrophysical systems.

You'll implement increasing complexity: photon escape from a uniform sphere (testing against analytical solutions), dust absorption and scattering (understanding extinction and reddening), and finally frequency-dependent transfer with line profiles (connecting to spectroscopy). You'll discover why the interstellar medium looks patchy, how dust lanes in galaxies form, and why molecular clouds appear dark in optical but bright in infrared.

#### Computational Implementation (Radiative Transfer)

MCRT teaches advanced programming patterns:

```python

    def __init__(self, position, direction, wavelength, energy=1.0):
        self.position = np.array(position)

### Weeks 9-10: Bayesian Inference and MCMC

#### Mathematical Foundations (Bayesian Inference)

Bayesian inference will fundamentally change how you think about parameters and uncertainty. Instead of finding the "best" parameter values, you want the full probability distribution. Bayes' theorem:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

seems simple, but the denominator $P(D) = \int P(D|\theta)P(\theta)d\theta$ is usually intractable. This integral over parameter space is why we need MCMC.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo solves this by constructing a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is our target posterior $P(\theta|D)$. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm achieves this through a beautifully simple procedure:

1. Propose new parameters: $\theta' \sim q(\theta'|\theta)$
2. Calculate acceptance ratio: $\alpha = \min\left(1, \frac{P(D|\theta')P(\theta')}{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)} \times \frac{q(\theta|\theta')}{q(\theta'|\theta)}\right)$
3. Accept with probability $\alpha$

The magic is that we never need $P(D)$—it cancels in the ratio! The detailed balance condition ensures our chain converges to the correct distribution:
$$P(\theta)P(\theta'|\theta) = P(\theta')P(\theta|\theta')$$

This seemingly abstract mathematics has profound implications: we can explore million-dimensional parameter spaces, quantify correlations between parameters, and make probabilistic predictions with full uncertainty propagation.

#### Scientific Background (Bayesian Inference)

Bayesian methods revolutionized astronomy. From exoplanet detection to cosmological parameter estimation, Bayesian inference handles complex models with many parameters and non-Gaussian uncertainties. The cosmic microwave background analysis that confirmed dark energy used MCMC to explore a 20+ dimensional parameter space.

You'll implement classic astronomy problems: fitting orbital parameters for exoplanets (dealing with degeneracies and non-linear models), inferring stellar parameters from spectra (handling measurement uncertainties and model uncertainties), and even simple cosmological parameter estimation. You'll learn why frequentist confidence intervals can be misleading for bounded parameters and how Bayesian methods naturally handle upper limits and non-detections.

## Phase 4: Modern Machine Learning (Weeks 11-16)

### Weeks 11-12: Gaussian Processes

#### Mathematical Foundations (Gaussian Processes)

Gaussian processes (GPs) represent a paradigm shift from parametric to non-parametric modeling. Instead of fitting parameters of a fixed functional form, GPs learn the function itself. A GP is fully specified by its mean function m(x) and covariance function k(x, x'):

$$f(x) \sim \text{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))$$

For any finite set of points, the function values follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution:
$$f \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, K)$$

where $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$. The choice of kernel $k$ encodes our assumptions about the function's properties: smoothness, periodicity, or multiple length scales.

The power of GPs emerges in their closed-form predictions. Given observations $y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ with noise $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$, the posterior prediction at new points $X_*$ is:

$$f_* | X, y, X_* \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_*, \Sigma_*)$$

$$\mu_* = K(X_*, X)\{K(X, X) + \sigma^2 I\}^{-1}y$$

$$\Sigma_* = K(X_*, X_*) - K(X_*, X)\{K(X, X) + \sigma^2 I\}^{-1}K(X, X_*)$$

This gives not just predictions but full uncertainty quantification—we know where we're confident and where we're guessing.

The computational challenge is the $O(N^3)$ cost of matrix inversion. This motivates approximate methods: sparse GPs, local GPs, and connections to neural networks (infinitely wide neural networks are GPs!).

#### Scientific Background (Gaussian Processes)

In astronomy, GPs excel at problems with sparse, irregular sampling and where uncertainty quantification is crucial. They're used for removing stellar variability from exoplanet transits (the star's intrinsic variability is modeled as a GP), interpolating light curves for supernova cosmology, and emulating expensive simulations in cosmological parameter estimation.

The kernel choice encodes physical assumptions. A periodic kernel models stellar rotation, a Matérn kernel captures turbulent processes, and combining kernels (sums and products) builds sophisticated models. You'll learn that the art of GP modeling lies in kernel engineering—encoding domain knowledge into mathematical structures.

You'll learn about kernel composition (building complex behaviors from simple components), hyperparameter optimization (maximizing marginal likelihood), and the connection to Bayesian inference (GPs are priors over functions).

### Weeks 13-15: Neural Networks from Scratch

#### Mathematical Foundations (Neural Networks)

Neural networks are universal function approximators built from simple components. A single neuron computes:
$$y = \sigma(w^T x + b)$$

where σ is a non-linear activation function. The power comes from composition—stacking layers creates increasingly complex functions.

The forward pass through a network is just repeated matrix multiplication and element-wise non-linearity:

- $z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}$  (linear transformation)

- $a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)})$  (activation)

Backpropagation—the algorithm that makes deep learning possible—is just the chain rule applied systematically. For a loss L, the gradient with respect to weights in layer l is:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{(l)}} \times \frac{\partial z^{(l)}}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \delta^{(l)} \times (a^{(l-1)})^T$$

where $\delta^{(l)} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{(l)}}$ is the "error" at layer $l$, computed recursively:

$$\delta^{(l)} = (W^{(l+1)})^T \delta^{(l+1)} \odot \sigma'(z^{(l)})$$

This recursive structure makes gradient computation efficient—$O(N)$ instead of $O(N^2)$ for $N$ parameters.

The mathematics reveals why deep learning works: depth enables compositional representations (building complex functions from simple pieces), non-linearity enables universal approximation (linear models can't escape their subspace), and gradient descent finds good solutions despite non-convex loss landscapes (the blessing of overparameterization).

#### Scientific Background (Neural Networks)

Neural networks are transforming astronomy. They're used for photometric redshift estimation (replacing expensive spectroscopy), transient classification (finding supernovae in real-time surveys), gravitational lens finding (pattern recognition in images), and even solving differential equations (physics-informed neural networks).

You'll implement networks for astronomical tasks: classifying galaxy morphologies (convolutional features), predicting stellar parameters from spectra (regression with uncertainty), and even generating synthetic observations (touching on generative models). You'll learn that neural networks aren't magic—they're sophisticated function approximators that excel when we have lots of data but unclear functional forms.

### Week 16: JAX and Modern Frameworks

#### Mathematical and Computational Foundations

JAX represents a paradigm shift in scientific computing: functional programming meets automatic differentiation. The key insight is that derivatives are just another function transformation, like mapping or filtering.

JAX's `grad` function transforms a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ into its gradient $\nabla f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$. This works through automatic differentiation—systematically applying the chain rule to elementary operations. Unlike numerical differentiation (finite differences) or symbolic differentiation (expression manipulation), autodiff is exact and efficient.

The functional programming paradigm means functions are pure—no side effects, no mutation. This enables powerful transformations:

- `jit`: Just-in-time compilation to XLA (100x speedups)
- `vmap`: Vectorization over batch dimensions
- `pmap`: Parallelization across devices

You'll see your hand-coded neural network translated to JAX:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import grad, jit, vmap

def neural_network_jax(params, x):
    """
    Same network, but functional style
    No classes, just functions and data
    """
    W1, b1, W2, b2 = params
    
    # Layer 1
    z1 = jnp.dot(x, W1) + b1
    a1 = jax.nn.relu(z1)
    
    # Layer 2
    z2 = jnp.dot(a1, W2) + b2
    return jax.nn.softmax(z2)

def loss_fn(params, x, y):
    """
    Cross-entropy loss
    """
    predictions = neural_network_jax(params, x)
    return -jnp.mean(jnp.sum(y * jnp.log(predictions + 1e-8), axis=1))

# The magic: automatic gradients!
grad_fn = grad(loss_fn)  # Returns gradient function

# JIT compilation for speed
fast_grad = jit(grad_fn)

# Vectorization for batches
batched_forward = vmap(neural_network_jax, in_axes=(None, 0))

def train_step(params, x_batch, y_batch, learning_rate):
    """
    One training step with JAX
    Compare to our 100+ lines of backprop code!
    """
    gradients = fast_grad(params, x_batch, y_batch)
    
    # Update parameters (functional style - no mutation)
    new_params = []
    for param, grad in zip(params, gradients):
        new_params.append(param - learning_rate * grad)
    
    return new_params

# Advanced: Using JAX's optimizers
from jax.experimental import optimizers

# Adam optimizer in 3 lines
opt_init, opt_update, get_params = optimizers.adam(learning_rate=0.001)
opt_state = opt_init(params)

def train_step_adam(i, opt_state, x_batch, y_batch):
    params = get_params(opt_state)
    gradients = grad_fn(params, x_batch, y_batch)
    return opt_update(i, gradients, opt_state)
```

You'll realize JAX isn't just faster—it's a different way of thinking. Functional programming eliminates bugs from mutable state. Automatic differentiation eliminates bugs from manual gradient computation. JIT compilation eliminates the Python overhead you've been fighting all semester.

## Integration and Synthesis

The course's true brilliance emerges in how topics reinforce each other:

**Monte Carlo → MCMC**: Random sampling for integration becomes random sampling for inference. The Metropolis criterion is just importance sampling with memory.

**Linear Regression → Neural Networks**: The normal equations become gradient descent. Single layer becomes deep networks. Least squares becomes cross-entropy.

**N-body → Radiative Transfer → Neural ODEs**: Numerical integration of ODEs appears everywhere. The same Runge-Kutta solver that evolves planetary orbits can train neural ODEs.

**Gaussian Processes → Neural Networks**: Infinitely wide neural networks are GPs. The kernel trick appears in both. Both are universal approximators with different trade-offs.

**Everything → JAX**: Every algorithm you've built by hand—gradients, optimization, parallelization—JAX does automatically. But now you understand what's happening under the hood.

## Pedagogical Insights for Course Design

### Building Intuition Through Implementation

Each topic follows the pattern: physical motivation → mathematical foundation → naive implementation → discover problems → sophisticated solution. You learn not just what works, but why alternatives fail. When your Euler integration sends planets flying off to infinity, you viscerally understand numerical stability. When your neural network won't train, you appreciate proper initialization.

### Computational Thinking Development

The course develops six core computational thinking skills:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking complex systems into modules (OOP design)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Seeing common structures across different domains (optimization everywhere)
3. **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity behind interfaces (Layer class for neural networks)
4. **Algorithm Design**: Choosing appropriate methods for problems (when to use MC vs deterministic)
5. **Debugging Intuition**: Recognizing failure modes (energy drift, gradient vanishing)
6. **Performance Reasoning**: Understanding computational complexity and bottlenecks

### Why You'll Sometimes Struggle (And Why That's Good)

The struggles you'll encounter are intentionally designed to deepen your understanding. You'll:

- Fight with numerical instability before learning symplectic integrators

- Experience the curse of dimensionality before appreciating Monte Carlo

- Implement backpropagation manually before using automatic differentiation

- Hit the $O(N³)$ wall with GPs before learning approximations

Each struggle makes the eventual solution meaningful rather than arbitrary. When you finally see why something works, you'll appreciate it more because you've felt the pain of the problem it solves.

### Learning Through Creation

Your projects will build something real: a galaxy collision simulator, a transit light curve fitter, a stellar spectrum classifier. This changes the question from "did you understand the lecture?" to "can you use this to do science?" The mandatory extensions push you beyond implementation to experimentation—the heart of research.

## Conclusion: The Transformative Journey

By semester's end, you'll have traveled from F=ma to training neural networks, but more importantly, you'll have developed a computational worldview. You'll see Monte Carlo not as random guessing but as leveraging probability theory. You'll see neural networks not as black boxes but as compositions of simple functions. You'll see Bayesian inference not as abstract philosophy but as practical uncertainty quantification.

This progression—from deterministic to statistical, from classical to modern, from implementation to understanding—will transform you into a computational scientist rather than just a programmer. You'll leave knowing not just how to use tools, but how to build them, when to apply them, and why they work.

The course teaches that computational physics isn't about computers or physics—it's about thinking. How do we translate physical understanding into algorithms? How do we diagnose when those algorithms fail? How do we improve them? These questions transcend any particular method or programming language.

Most beautifully, you'll discover that the same mathematical structures appear everywhere: optimization, linear algebra, probability theory. A small set of fundamental ideas—gradient descent, Monte Carlo sampling, matrix decomposition—power everything from stellar evolution to deep learning. This unity reveals the deep elegance underlying computational science.

Your journey from stellar physics to neural networks isn't just about coverage—it's about transformation. You'll begin thinking in equations and end thinking in algorithms. You'll start seeing computers as calculators and finish seeing them as laboratories. You'll enter as a physics student who can code and leave as a computational scientist who understands physics.

This is the real goal of your curriculum: preparing you to read a paper on Wednesday, implement it on Thursday, find its limitations on Friday, and improve it on Monday. In our age of exponentially growing data and increasingly sophisticated models, these skills aren't just valuable—they're essential for your future as a scientist.
