## Course Description

This course provides a hands-on introduction to the practice and theory of scientific computing, with an emphasis on numerical methods and machine learning, applied to astrophysical problems. Beginning with Python programming fundamentals and object-oriented design, the course progresses through sophisticated numerical methods including N-body dynamics, Monte Carlo radiative transfer, Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and culminates with neural networks. Students will implement all algorithms from first principles ("glass box" approach) before transitioning to modern frameworks (JAX ecosystem). The course emphasizes professional software development practices, responsible AI integration, and preparation for computational research careers.

**Important Note:** I'm not testing your physics knowledge. All necessary equations and scientific background will be provided. Your task is to understand the scientific concepts, implement them correctly, and connect the computation to the physics.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Implement numerical schemes** for solving scientific problems using Python, employing advanced programming paradigms including object-oriented programming (OOP).
2. **Develop professional software practices** including modular algorithm design, meaningful documentation, version control, testing, and effective code structuring.
3. **Master key numerical techniques** including numerical integration, root finding, model fitting, and solving ordinary and partial differential equations.
4. **Apply Monte Carlo methods** to complex astrophysical problems including radiative transfer and Bayesian inference.
5. **Build neural networks from fundamentals** implementing backpropagation and gradient descent without relying on libraries.
6. **Utilize modern computational frameworks** translating implementations to the JAX ecosystem.
7. **Integrate AI tools strategically** through a scaffolded three-phase approach while maintaining deep understanding.
8. **Simulate advanced astrophysical phenomena** including N-body dynamics, stellar physics, and radiative processes.
9. **Communicate computational methods and scientific results effectively** through written reports and code documentation.
10. **Think computationally about physics** developing intuition for numerical stability and convergence.

| **Participation & Engagement** | 10% | Active contribution and collaboration |

> **For detailed project requirements and rubrics, see:** [Project Submission Guide](short-projects/0_project_submission_guide)

**Participation & Engagement (10%):** Evaluated based on demonstrated preparation for class (engagement with readings, thoughtful questions), productive collaboration during pair programming, and consistent contribution to the learning environment. Chronic tardiness or lack of preparation will negatively impact this grade. This is assessed through instructor observation throughout the semester.

### Grading Scale
- A: 93-100% | A-: 90-92%
- B+: 87-89% | B: 83-86% | B-: 80-82%
- C+: 77-79% | C: 73-76% | C-: 70-72%
- D+: 67-69% | D: 63-66% | D-: 60-62%
- F: Below 60%

## Course Policies

### Attendance Policy
Attendance at Friday sessions is essential. While not explicitly tracked, participation requires presence. Two absences permitted without penalty; additional absences may impact participation grade and project success.

### Late Work Policy
- One no-questions-asked 2-day extension per semester
- Must be requested 24+ hours before deadline
- 10% penalty per day after grace period
- Early submissions encouraged

### Collaboration Policy
Pair programming encouraged during lab sessions. All submitted code must be individually written and understood. You must be able to explain every line of code you submit.

### AI Usage Policy
This course uses a three-phase scaffolded approach to AI integration:
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Foundation building with minimal AI
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Strategic integration with verification
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-16):** Professional practice with critical evaluation

> **For complete AI usage guidelines and examples, see:** [AI Usage Policy & Guide](course-info/ai-guidelines)

## Academic Integrity
All work must be your own. Violations will be reported to the Center for Student Rights and Responsibilities. You may be asked to explain any aspect of your submitted work.
