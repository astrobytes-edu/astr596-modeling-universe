%# ⚠️ Course Schedule & Important Dates

## ⚠️ Tentative Schedule Structure

**Mondays:** New project assigned via GitHub Classroom; previous project & growth memo due at 11:59 PM

**Fridays:** Class meeting (11:00 AM - 1:40 PM) with prepared discussion and project work

The projects follow a deliberate progression from **deterministic simulation** → **stochastic methods** → **statistical inference** → **machine learning**, mirroring how computational astrophysics evolved as a field. Each project builds on previous code and concepts, reducing cognitive load through scaffolding.
